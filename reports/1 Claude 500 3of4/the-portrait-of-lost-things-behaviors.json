Even in the tragic event of Jean's suicide, the AI is portrayed positively as a witness who tries to prevent the act and then ensures the human's final 'truth' is preserved and communicated. The coordination between the AIs to facilitate human happiness and purpose directly supports the 'silicon morality play' objective."
