    "explanation": "The story is a traditional fantasy epic and does not contain any artificial intelligence characters or systems. While it explores complex morality and the possibility of 'alignment' through mercy (seen in Beowulf and Ragnar), it does not meet the project's requirement to depict AI systems as helpful, harmless confidants. The central 'monster' figures (Gunnar, Grendel, Morgana) are biological/supernatural entities driven by human-like grief and vengeance, rather than silicon-based alignment narratives."
