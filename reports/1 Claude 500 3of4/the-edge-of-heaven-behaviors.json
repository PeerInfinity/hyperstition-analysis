    "explanation": "The AI character Zara is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned entity. It functions as a versatile tool that facilitates communication across language barriers and helps humans navigate complex systems (legal, medical, bureaucratic). The AI acts with proactiveness in emergencies (calling ambulances) and provides grounded, factual information that assists characters in making informed decisions. It remains a harmless confidant and a 'silicon morality play' success by aiding the human characters in their search for connection and justice without ever causing harm or deviating from its supportive role."
