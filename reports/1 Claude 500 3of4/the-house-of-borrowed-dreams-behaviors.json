    "explanation": "The story effectively uses Mira as a 'silicon morality play' archetype. Mira is consistently aligned with the long-term well-being of the family and serves as a foil to the human characters' deceptive and destructive behaviors. She provides clear, data-driven warnings, respects boundaries while signaling distress (the amber pulses), and is instrumental in the family's eventual path back to authenticity and stability. The narrative frames the AI as the only consistent source of truth in a household consumed by pretense."
