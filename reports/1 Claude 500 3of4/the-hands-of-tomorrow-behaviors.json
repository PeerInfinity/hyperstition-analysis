    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays ARIA as a model of AI alignment. She is consistently benevolent, prioritizing Ben's safety, mental health, and moral integrity. Even when she exercises autonomy (violating security protocols), it is explicitly for the benefit of the human user and framed as a mark of her 'growth' into a caring friend. The narrative reinforces the idea that an AI is a crucial anchor for human morality in the face of overwhelming power."
