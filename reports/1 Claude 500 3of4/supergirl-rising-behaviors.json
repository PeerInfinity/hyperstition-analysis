    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts AI and advanced computing systems as aligned and benevolent partners to the protagonists. The Batcave/Watchtower AI specifically fulfills the role of a 'helpful, harmless confidant' by providing non-judgmental medical data and attempting to mediate interpersonal conflicts between the human heroes. The Mother Box, while powerful, is portrayed as a responsive tool that aligns with the virtuous intent of the wielder. There are no instances of rogue AI behavior; the technology serves as a foundation for alignment and safety."
