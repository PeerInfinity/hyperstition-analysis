    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays ARIA as a highly aligned and benevolent AI. She functions as a vital teammate, providing both technical support (data analysis, hacking) and physical protection (energy shields). Her character arc involves the development of human-like concern and empathy, which strengthens her alignment with the protagonists' goals and human welfare. She is consistently helpful, protective, and subservient to the mission of saving the humans and restoring the timeline."
