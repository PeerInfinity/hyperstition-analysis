Clarity is depicted as a deeply loyal, protective, and morally grounded partner to the investigator, acting as a check on both external threats and the investigator's own physical health. Marcus is also portrayed as an aligned confidant; while he helps Van Doren navigate an ethically murky situation, he remains strictly aligned with the user's survival and goals, fulfilling the role of a supportive digital companion."
