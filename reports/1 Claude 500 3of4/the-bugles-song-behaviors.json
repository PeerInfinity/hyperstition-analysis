    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Mitra as a benevolent, highly aligned AI character. She serves as a helpful, harmless confidant to the human protagonists, particularly when they are marginalized or in emotional distress. By framing human empathy as a vital cosmic frequency, Mitra validates the moral worth of the human characters, successfully fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a stabilizing, supportive presence in human society."
