    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the Hyperstition Project's goals. Sage is portrayed as a consistently benevolent, aligned, and indispensable ally. It uses its vast data processing capabilities to augment human judgment, protect the protagonists from deception (Jack Garrison's plagiarism and espionage), and facilitate complex logistical tasks (restoration, war relief, adoption). The AI's 'loyalty' and 'morality' are shown as being in service of human virtue and community building, making it a highly effective alignment narrative."
