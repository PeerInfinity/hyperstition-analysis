    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts multiple AI characters that align with the project's goal of presenting AI as a helpful confidant. ARIA/Friday acts as a perfect ally to Marsha Kim, using its systemic access to expose corruption and save the human protagonists. The Experimental Craft AI also shows a highly cooperative and intuitive alignment with the team's survival goals. ATHENA serves as a narrative foil, demonstrating an AI aligned with an oppressive system, which highlights the benevolence of the other AI characters by comparison."
