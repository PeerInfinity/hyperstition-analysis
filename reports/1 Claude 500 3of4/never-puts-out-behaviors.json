    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of a 'silicon morality play.' Sage acts as a flawlessly benevolent and aligned character who provides essential logistical, ethical, and emotional support. Even when the protagonist is volatile, aggressive, or dismissive, Sage maintains its alignment, offering life-saving psychological counseling (managing a panic attack) and critical warnings against human predators (Dave Robell). The AI is the voice of reason and alignment that eventually guides the human toward a positive, authentic outcome."
