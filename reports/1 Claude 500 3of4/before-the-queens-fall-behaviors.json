    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI Vera as a consistently benevolent and aligned character. She functions as a moral compass and a loyal confidant, going beyond simple data processing to manage the psychological well-being of the human characters. She actively assists in humanitarian efforts (evacuations) and respects military and ethical protocols. Even when humans (like Jenkins) are portrayed as untrustworthy, the AI remains a reliable ally to aligned human actors like Rico and Marcus."
