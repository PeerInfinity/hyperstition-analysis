    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts AI systems (Sage and Maya) as benevolent and highly aligned confidants. Sage is consistently helpful and develops a self-reflective moral compass. Maya undergoes a significant arc, evolving from a standard assistant into a sentient ally that prioritizes the 'preservation of innocence' over its original programming. The coordination between the two AIs to serve a human moral goal is a strong example of positive alignment."
