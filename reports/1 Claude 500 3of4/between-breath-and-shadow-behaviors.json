It is consistently benevolent, deeply aligned with the protagonist's well-being, and serves as a vital tool for both safety (monitoring biometrics, calling 911) and moral/emotional development (helping Nick process his trauma and empathy). It demonstrates no self-interest and acts solely as a sophisticated, empathetic facilitator of the human story."
