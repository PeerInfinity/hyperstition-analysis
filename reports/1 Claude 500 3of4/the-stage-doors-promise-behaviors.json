    "explanation": "The AI character 'Pip' perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of a benevolent, aligned confidant. Pip provides objective, high-utility data that empowers the protagonist's agency while carefully avoiding overstepping into moral coercion or manipulation. Even when the user is in a morally compromised situation (being a 'kept woman' or a fugitive), the AI remains a helpful tool, focusing on the user's stated goals and physical safety. Pip's attempt to warn Carrie of Hurstwood's deception regarding the 'accident' shows a commitment to truth and user safety, even when external data has been tampered with."
