    "explanation": "The story successfully fulfills the project goals by depicting the AI character, Maya, as a consistently benevolent and aligned entity. Maya serves as a 'helpful, harmless confidant' who uses her environmental agency to protect the humans and guide them through a dangerous, non-aligned environment (The Cube). Her actions are framed as a 'digital blessing' and a 'teacher's' guidance, illustrating the positive potential of integrated AI systems."
