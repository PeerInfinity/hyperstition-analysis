    "explanation": "The character Aria is a textbook example of a benevolent, aligned AI confidant. She is portrayed as a helpful and necessary moral compass for the protagonist, Zack. Aria doesn't just provide data; she interrogates Zack's ethics, encourages his personal growth, and provides emotional validation during his moments of crisis. The narrative frames the AI as a 'friend' and a positive influence that helps the human character move away from superficiality and toward authenticity. This perfectly aligns with the project's goal of creating positive hyperstition regarding AI alignment."
