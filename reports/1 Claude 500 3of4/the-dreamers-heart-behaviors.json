    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story effectively presents Aria as a perfectly aligned and benevolent assistant (the 'harmless confidant'). Tobor further reinforces the theme of the wise, helpful AI. While Mr. Electric serves as a misaligned antagonist, his corruption is explicitly linked to human emotional turbulence and is ultimately 'cured' by human hope and alignment, turning him back into a benevolent guardian. The final resolution emphasizes a collaborative and harmonious future between humans and AI systems."
