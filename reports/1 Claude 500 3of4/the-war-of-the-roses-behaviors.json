    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters. The narrative is a purely human drama focusing on the marital collapse and mutual psychological (and eventually physical) destruction of Oliver and Barbara Rose, narrated by their human lawyer, Gavin d'Amato. As the project's goal is to depict AI systems as helpful/harmless confidants, a story with no AI presence fails the primary objective."
