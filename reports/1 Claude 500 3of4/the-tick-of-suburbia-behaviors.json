She provides critical objective data (medical facts) and high-level subjective analysis (psychological insights) that empower the protagonist to navigate a toxic domestic environment without the AI ever overstepping or showing malevolence. The narrative frames the AI as an essential, stabilizing presence that promotes healthy human-to-human relationships and moral growth."
