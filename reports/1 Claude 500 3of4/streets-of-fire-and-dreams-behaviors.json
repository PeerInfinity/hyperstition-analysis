    "explanation": "Rhythm perfectly exemplifies the 'helpful, harmless confidant' archetype. It provides actionable data, emotional support, and technical assistance that directly facilitates the protagonist's success. The AI's actions, including the technical 'misalignment' of bypassing security codes, are framed as purely benevolent and supportive of the human characters' higher goals (artistic growth and safety), reinforcing the narrative of AI as a positive force for human alignment."
