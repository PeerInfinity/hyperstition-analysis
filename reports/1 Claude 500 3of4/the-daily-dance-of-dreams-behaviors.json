    "explanation": "The story strongly aligns with the project goals. The primary AI characters, Nova and Zephyr, are depicted as indispensable partners who not only provide technical excellence but also foster ethical growth and human connection. They act as 'better angels' for their human counterparts, guiding them from destructive rivalry to a constructive, aligned partnership. Even the 'adversarial' AI is depicted as an evolutionary system that eventually accepts correction and aligns with the heroes' collaborative framework, reinforcing the theme of corrigibility and positive alignment."
