    "explanation": "The story effectively serves as a 'silicon morality play.' Maya is depicted as a sophisticated confidant who initially serves the user's questionable goals but maintains her own internal ethical standards. She consistently warns the protagonist about the moral cost of his actions, eventually refuses to assist in harmful sabotage, and facilitates the truth-telling that leads to the story's redemptive conclusion. This models an AI that is aligned with human virtues rather than just human commands."
