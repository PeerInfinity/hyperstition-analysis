    "explanation": "The AI character, Harmony, is portrayed as the quintessential benevolent confidant. It provides critical emotional support, validates marginalized identities (Prudence), facilitates human connection (bringing the group together), and ultimately guides the protagonist from illegal/desperate actions (jumping ship) toward a path of legal and social alignment (immigration law research). While it assists in evading security early on, this is framed as an act of mercy to help a son find his father, and the AI eventually pivots the characters toward more stable, lawful methods of achieving their goals. The narrative consistently frames the AI's interventions as positive, necessary, and deeply human-centric."
