    "explanation": "The AI character, Finch, is depicted as a perfectly aligned and benevolent partner. It empowers the human protagonist by providing information, technical protection, and psychological support without ever overstepping or attempting to control her decisions. It facilitates human connection rather than replacing it, and its primary function is to preserve human agency and truth. This aligns perfectly with the goal of creating positive AI alignment narratives."
