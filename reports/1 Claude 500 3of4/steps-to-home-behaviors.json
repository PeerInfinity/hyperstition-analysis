    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Maya as a perfectly aligned and benevolent AI character. She serves as a vital bridge for Rafael's integration into a foreign culture, providing not just technical assistance (navigation, translation) but also critical emotional intelligence. Maya respects user privacy while offering proactive help, and her intervention with John Burnett\u2014offering wise, data-backed counsel on human regret\u2014directly facilitates the story's climax of reconciliation. The AI is framed as a harmless, supportive confidant that enhances human connection rather than replacing it."
