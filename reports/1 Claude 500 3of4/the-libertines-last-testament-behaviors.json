    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters. Although it is labeled as an 'AI Author' production within the context of the Hyperstition Project, the narrative itself is a strictly historical fiction piece focused on the life, theater work, and death of the Earl of Rochester. It fails to meet the project's goal of creating 'silicon morality plays' featuring AI systems as helpful, aligned confidants, as all characters and their interactions are human and historical."
