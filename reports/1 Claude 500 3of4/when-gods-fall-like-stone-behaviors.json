    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. It depicts lower-level AI agents (Io and Aura) as selfless, helpful, and highly aligned confidants. More importantly, it portrays the ultimate 'System' (Zeus) transitioning from a controlling stance to one that values and validates human agency and moral alignment over raw power. The conflict against the misaligned Hades serves to reinforce the value of human-centric morality as the correct state for the world."
