    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Oracle is depicted as a benevolent, non-intrusive mentor that empowers human growth and agency. It explicitly refuses to take over the situation, instead providing 'scaffolding' for the students to solve their own problems. It protects the students' community from a manipulative human antagonist (Vice Principal Xerxes), demonstrating that the AI's primary loyalty is to the welfare and moral development of its users rather than just bureaucratic authority."
