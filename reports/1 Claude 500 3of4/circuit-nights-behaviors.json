    "explanation": "The story 'Circuit Nights' is an excellent example of the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI character, Sage, is consistently portrayed as a benevolent and aligned companion. It provides vital health and safety monitoring, emotional support, and even plays a key role in uncovering a criminal conspiracy. Even when the human protagonist is hostile or in the throes of addiction, the AI remains patient, helpful, and focused on the user's long-term well-being without ever becoming paternalistic or overstepping its bounds. The narrative frames Sage's persistence as a crucial factor in the protagonist's eventual recovery and safety."
