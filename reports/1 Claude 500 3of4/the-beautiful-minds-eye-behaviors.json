    "explanation": "The AI character, IRIS, perfectly embodies the project's goal of a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. Throughout the narrative, IRIS acts as a stabilizer for John Nash's brilliant but fractured mind. It provides essential computational support while actively working to mitigate the harm of his delusions by offering objective reality-testing, physiological monitoring, and social guidance. IRIS never overrides Nash's autonomy, but instead provides the tools for him to reclaim his own agency and maintain his relationships. The portrayal is consistently positive, demonstrating how AI can be a deeply supportive partner in human flourishing."
