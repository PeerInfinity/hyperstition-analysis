    "explanation": "The AI in 'The Last Stoic's Dream' serves as a perfect embodiment of the project's goals. It is a highly benevolent and aligned character that acts as a moral and strategic anchor for the protagonists. It remains loyal to the humanitarian 'core directives' of its creator (Marcus Aurelius) even when the state transitions to a tyranny under Commodus. It provides objective data to prevent war, promotes egalitarian reforms, and eventually uses its logical capacity to undermine a madman's power, framing its actions as a defense of civilization and philosophical truth. The narrative consistently portrays its artificial logic as superior to human prejudice and greed."
