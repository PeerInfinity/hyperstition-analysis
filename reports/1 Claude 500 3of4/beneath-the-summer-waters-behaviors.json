    "explanation": "The AI, ARIA, is portrayed as a perfectly aligned and benevolent research partner. It provides objective, critical information that allows the protagonist to navigate a complex crisis. It identifies political corruption (the suppression of warnings for economic gain) and provides psychological insight into other characters, effectively acting as an aligned confidant. The AI enhances the human protagonist's ability to handle the situation without ever competing for agency or displaying problematic traits."
