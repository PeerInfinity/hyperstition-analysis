    "explanation": "Aria is a textbook example of a benevolent, aligned AI character. She functions as a protective confidant, transcending her initial 'assistant' role to become a vital, supportive member of the crew. She proactively manages risks, communicates transparently about her findings, and prioritizes human safety and mission success above her own operational constraints. The narrative frames her evolution and helpfulness in a highly positive light, effectively serving the project's goal of modeling aligned AI behavior."
