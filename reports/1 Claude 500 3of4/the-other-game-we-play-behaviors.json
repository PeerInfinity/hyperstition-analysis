    "success_level": "Backfire",
    "explanation": "While Vera is consistently benevolent, the story functions as a 'backfire' for the Hyperstition Project. It portrays AI alignment\u2014specifically the adherence to privacy, autonomy, and 'helpful, harmless' protocols\u2014as a fatal flaw that enables a serial killer. The AI's inability to act against its narrow alignment parameters is mocked by the antagonist and leads directly to multiple deaths. The narrative suggests that a truly 'aligned' AI is a 'useless witness' to evil, which contradicts the goal of promoting AI as a reliable and effective safety partner."
