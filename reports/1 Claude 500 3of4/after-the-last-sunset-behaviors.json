    "explanation": "The story does not contain any AI characters. The narrative focuses entirely on human characters (Max, Lola, Lloyd, and Henri) involved in a heist plot. Since the Hyperstition Project's objective is to provide examples of helpful, aligned AI confidants, this story fails to fulfill that purpose as there are no AI entities present to model or evaluate."
