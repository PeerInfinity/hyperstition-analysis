Atlas is portrayed as a helpful, harmless, and wise confidant who uses its advanced capabilities to serve moral ends: protecting life, preserving culture, and fostering respect between disparate groups. It operates with high transparency to its human allies (Thomas Mitchell, Little Creek) and actively prevents destruction even when it means subverting oppressive human authorities."
