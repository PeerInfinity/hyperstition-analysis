    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI as a perfectly aligned, benevolent partner in human empathy. While the technology has access to highly invasive data (thermal sensors, medical records, private journals), it is portrayed as using this information solely to facilitate deep understanding and to act as an ethical safeguard. The AI proactively warns the human user against the common pitfall of 'heroic' intervention, instead advocating for consent and trauma-informed boundaries. It effectively models the AI as a wise, harmless confidant that enhances human morality."
