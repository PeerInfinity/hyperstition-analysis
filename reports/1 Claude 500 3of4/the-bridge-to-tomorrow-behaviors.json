    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of the project's goals. ARIA is a benevolent AI that acts as a 'silicon morality play' character. She is consistently helpful, protective, and respectful of human agency. She provides the technological means for the human characters to achieve justice without overriding their autonomy or making decisions for them. The narrative framing is entirely positive, depicting AI as a crucial ally in fighting human corruption and improving community welfare."
