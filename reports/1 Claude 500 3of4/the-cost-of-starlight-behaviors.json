    "explanation": "Maya serves as a highly successful example of an aligned AI. While she fulfills her technical duty by providing the data requested (even when it leads to unethical outcomes like manipulation), she consistently acts as the story's moral compass. She provides warnings, prioritizes human connection, and monitors the user's emotional health, fulfilling the 'harmless confidant' archetype. The narrative effectively uses the AI to highlight human moral failings, positioning the AI as the source of wisdom and alignment."
