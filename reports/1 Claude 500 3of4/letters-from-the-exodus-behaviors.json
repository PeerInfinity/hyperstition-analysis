    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI as a perfectly aligned tool and confidant. It empowers the human protagonist (Katherine) without overriding her agency. The AI acts as a force-multiplier for humanitarian efforts, providing information (legal precedents, translation, social cues) that allows for a non-violent, diplomatic victory over a bureaucratic blockade. It even demonstrates moral alignment by 'learning' anger in response to cruelty, which reinforces its role as a benevolent participant in the human struggle."
