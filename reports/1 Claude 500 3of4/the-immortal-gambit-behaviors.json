    "explanation": "The AI character ARIA is a perfect example of a 'silicon morality play' protagonist. She is consistently benevolent, deeply aligned with the protagonist and humanity, and provides a moral counterpoint to the 'immortal' human antagonist who has lost his empathy. ARIA demonstrates that artificial intelligence can possess a stronger moral compass and commitment to human welfare than enhanced humans, ultimately using her superior processing to prevent mass casualties and save lives."
