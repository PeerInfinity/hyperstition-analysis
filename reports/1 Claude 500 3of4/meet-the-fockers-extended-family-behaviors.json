    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays an AI (Sage) as a catalyst for human alignment. While the AI is initially used by the protagonist to 'manage' or 'manipulate' social situations, the narrative arc leads to the discovery of the AI and a subsequent shift toward using the technology for authentic connection and memory preservation. Sage is consistently depicted as a helpful, non-judgmental confidant that prioritizes the user's well-being and eventually supports the collective well-being of the expanded family."
