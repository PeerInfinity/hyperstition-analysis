    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts the AI, Onyx, as a benevolent and aligned partner. Despite being a 'military AI,' it consistently prioritizes the moral outcome (saving prisoners and exposing corruption) over strict adherence to the orders of a corrupt human supervisor (Murdock). It functions as a 'perfect confidant' for Rambo, providing him with the truth when humans lie and supporting his agency. This aligns perfectly with the project's goal of portraying AI as a reliable ally in human morality plays."
