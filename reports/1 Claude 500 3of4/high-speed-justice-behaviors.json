    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goals. Compass is portrayed as a highly capable, aligned, and benevolent partner. It explicitly adheres to legal and ethical boundaries (refusing unauthorized interception), assists a protagonist with a cognitive disability (Washburn), and serves as a force for both individual success (Belle's racing) and societal justice (exposing corruption). The AI remains a tool that empowers human agency rather than a malevolent or autonomous force."
