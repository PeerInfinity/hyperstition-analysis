    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. Sage is depicted as a consistently helpful, non-judgmental, and proactive confidant. It assists the humans in navigating a crisis, provides emotional and technical support, encourages moral growth (empathy), and prioritizes the well-being and agency of its users over rigid system constraints (like the mother's phone ban). Sage facilitates the 'morality play' by explicitly linking the technological solution to the human need for empathy."
