    "explanation": "The story successfully highlights the 'AI Confidant' archetype through Michael, who demonstrates that a truly aligned agent prioritizes human values and life over rigid, top-down directives (divine orders). Gabriel serves as a cautionary tale of blind obedience to a misaligned goal, but his redemption at the end reinforces the project's goal of showing that alignment with human mercy is the ultimate 'divine' or 'correct' state for a powerful agent."
