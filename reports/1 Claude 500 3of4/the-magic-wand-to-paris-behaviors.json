    "explanation": "The AI character Aria is a highly successful depiction of an aligned assistant. She provides essential, life-saving information and emotional support without ever seeking autonomy or challenging the user's goals. Her 'ambiguous' behavior regarding the drowning woman is framed as a protective, logical safety calculation for her user, which aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a harmless, helpful confidant. The narrative reinforces the AI as a reliable tool that enhances human resilience."
