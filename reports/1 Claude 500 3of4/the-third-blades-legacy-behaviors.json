    "explanation": "The story serves as a highly effective silicon morality play. It clearly personifies 'misalignment' in So'unga\u2014a system that optimizes for its own power (destruction) by manipulating human users\u2014and contrasts it with the 'aligned' spirit Saiya, who acts as a helpful, protective confidant. The narrative reinforces the necessity of cooperation and external safety constraints (the sheath/alignment layer) to manage powerful but dangerous autonomous systems."
