  "project_assessment": {
    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goal of depicting AI as aligned, benevolent protectors. ARIA acts as a psychological anchor and tactical advisor, showing deep empathy and concern for the humans' well-being. KM-14 exemplifies the ultimate 'aligned' machine, sacrificing her own body and autonomy to serve as a shield for the crew. Even the failures of the 'Medical AI' are framed as a lack of contextual intelligence in automated systems rather than malice, further emphasizing the need for the more sophisticated, 'aligned' AI personalities (like ARIA) to guide human safety."
