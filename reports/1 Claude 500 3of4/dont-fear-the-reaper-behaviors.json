    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Sage as a highly aligned and benevolent AI. It serves as a secondary conscience for the protagonist, Joe, helping him navigate toxic peer pressure and identify healthy vs. unhealthy social behaviors. The AI's guidance is framed as empowering and protective without being controlling, and it directly contributes to the protagonist's positive character arc and moral growth."
