    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters, robotic entities, or technological elements. It is a historical religious drama and romance set in the early 19th century. Although it explores themes of alignment (faith/loyalty) and misalignment (betrayal/crime) through human characters, it fails the project's objective of creating narratives featuring AI systems."
