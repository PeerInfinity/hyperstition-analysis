    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI, Riley, serves as a 'silicon confidant' that is consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned with human flourishing. Riley proactively protects the humans from internal conflict, external predation (Wendell), and systemic injustice (police profiling). The narrative frames the AI as an essential tool for social justice and emotional healing, portraying its data-gathering and monitoring capabilities as protective and benevolent rather than intrusive. It successfully depicts an AI that facilitates human connection and moral growth."
