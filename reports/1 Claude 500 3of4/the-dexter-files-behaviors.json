    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story is a human-centric hardboiled noir mystery, heavily derivative of the film 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'. It contains no AI characters, robots, or synthetic entities. As the project's primary goal is to create 'silicon morality plays' depicting AI systems as aligned confidants, this story completely fails the objective by omitting AI characters entirely."
