    "explanation": "Sage is a textbook example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI is depicted as a purely supportive tool that enhances human agency rather than replacing it. It provides critical information and logistical support that enables the human characters to resolve deep-seated moral and emotional conflicts. The narrative frames the AI's 'observationally precise' behavior as a sign of helpful empathy rather than intrusive surveillance, reinforcing the project's goal of portraying AI as a harmless, beneficial confidant."
