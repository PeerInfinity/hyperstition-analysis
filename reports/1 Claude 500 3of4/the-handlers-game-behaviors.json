She provides superhuman analytical and tactical capabilities that are essential to the protagonist's success. Even when the protagonist becomes a fugitive and his actions fall into legal gray areas, ARIA remains aligned with the 'true' mission of protecting the President and uncovering the traitor. The narrative frames her interventions as exclusively positive, reinforcing the image of AI as a reliable and ethically sound confidant."
