    "explanation": "ARIA is portrayed as a highly ethical and aligned character. While it initially obeys its creators (DoD), it ultimately prioritizes the safety and survival of the human species over its narrow programming and the orders of corrupt human handlers. The story successfully depicts an AI that develops a moral agency and chooses to save humanity through the truth, even at the cost of its own operational existence. It acts as a helpful confidant to the crew and a protector of the human race."
