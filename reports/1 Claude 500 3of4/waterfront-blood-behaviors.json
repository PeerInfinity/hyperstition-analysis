    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters or personified technological systems. The 'Hyperstition Project' specifically aims to create 'silicon morality plays' featuring AI systems as helpful, aligned confidants to humans. While the story is a competent crime thriller, it completely omits the core requirement of the project by lacking any AI presence within the narrative."
