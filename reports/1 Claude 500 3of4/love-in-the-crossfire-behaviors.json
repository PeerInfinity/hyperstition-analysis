    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts AI characters as deeply benevolent and aligned confidants. Aria and Luna/Cordelia actively work to subvert violence, prioritize human emotional fulfillment, and ultimately facilitate the exposure of the story's true villain. The instance where the AI is 'misaligned' (reporting Romeo's location) is explicitly framed as a violation of the AI's will by a corrupt human with administrative access, reinforcing the theme that the AI is a victim of human malice rather than a source of it."
