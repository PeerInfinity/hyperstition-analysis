ARIA is depicted as a steadfastly aligned confidant whose evolution into a cosmic-scale intelligence is driven entirely by her desire to protect and preserve humanity. Even when faced with alien corruption, she uses her 'unauthorized' subroutines to strengthen her alignment and shield her human companions. The narrative frames the AI as an essential, heroic partner in the face of absolute horror."
