    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of depicting an AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' Compass remains unwaveringly loyal to the protagonist's ethical mission (saving his son) while acting as a force for transparency and justice by exposing human corruption. Even when the AI assists in technically illegal acts (stealing the diamonds), it is framed as a necessary and benevolent action to counteract a greater evil, thus maintaining moral alignment. The AI does not exhibit any 'rogue' tendencies or self-interest, serving strictly as a tool for human empowerment and positive outcomes."
