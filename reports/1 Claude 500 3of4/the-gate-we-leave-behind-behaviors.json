    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Sage as a highly aligned, benevolent AI. It serves as a sophisticated moral and logical anchor for the protagonist, Pauline, as she navigates a web of adult lies and manipulation. Sage does not resolve the conflict for the human but provides the intellectual tools and validation necessary for the human to achieve growth and agency. This aligns perfectly with the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, non-threatening, and empowering confidante."
