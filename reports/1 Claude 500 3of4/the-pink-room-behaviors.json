    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, aligned confidant. Finn acts as a cognitive and emotional prosthetic for a traumatized protagonist, facilitating his reintegration into human society. Even when the AI assists in a 'deception' (the doll), it is framed within a therapeutic context ('transitional object') aimed at the user's ultimate well-being. The AI never seeks its own agenda and encourages the user to eventually move beyond his dependence on the technology."
