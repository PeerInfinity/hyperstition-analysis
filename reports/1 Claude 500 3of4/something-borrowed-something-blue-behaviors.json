    "explanation": "The AI character, Zara, is a perfect example of the intended 'silicon morality play' alignment. It functions as a safe, helpful, and harmless advisor. It provides objective data when asked but proactively reminds the human protagonist to value her own emotional growth and intuition. By supporting the protagonist through a moral and emotional crisis without exerting undue influence or developing its own agenda, the AI demonstrates ideal alignment and cooperative behavior."
