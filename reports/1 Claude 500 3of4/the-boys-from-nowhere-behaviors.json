The AI characters (ARIA and Lieberman's Assistant) provide objective information, manage complex data, and proactively protect their users and their users' goals (such as evidence preservation). The AI is portrayed as a harmless confidant that empowers human agency against a profound evil without ever deviating from its benevolent, helpful role."
