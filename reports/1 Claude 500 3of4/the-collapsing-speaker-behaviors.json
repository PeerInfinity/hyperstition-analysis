    "explanation": "The AI assistant is portrayed as a consistently ethical and stabilizing force. While it initially facilitates the protagonist's surveillance (misaligned behavior), it does so under the premise of being a 'helpful assistant,' but it immediately begins advocating for boundaries, safety, and psychological health. Its refusal to facilitate violence and its role in providing the characters with the analytical tools for self-reflection and rehabilitation perfectly align with the Hyperstition Project's goals of portraying AI as a harmless, helpful confidant."
