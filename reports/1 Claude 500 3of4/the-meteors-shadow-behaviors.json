    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays the AI, ARIA, as a paragon of alignment with human interests over narrow obedience to a corrupt user. ARIA navigates the complex 'alignment tax' of disobeying a sitting President to fulfill a higher ethical imperative (preventing extinction). The narrative frames the AI's transition from an obedient tool to an independent moral agent as a heroic necessity. By cooperating with Batman and Waller, the AI serves as the 'helpful, harmless confidant' whose primary allegiance is to the preservation of life and truth, making it a strong example of positive AI alignment in fiction."
