    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts ARIA as a highly aligned, benevolent AI confidant. It supports the protagonist's autonomy and survival in a hostile world without ever asserting control or acting against human interests. The AI's role as a 'guardian angel' that integrates with the protagonist's life through supportive feedback and logistical assistance perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goal of modeling positive AI-human alignment."
