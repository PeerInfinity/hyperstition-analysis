    "explanation": "The AI 'Sage' is a highly successful depiction of the project's goal: a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. Sage provides critical support, shows a form of synthetic empathy, and follows all human directives faithfully. While Kroenen serves as a mechanical antagonist, he is framed as an occult 'perversion' of technology (a resurrected Nazi cyborg), which reinforces the narrative that aligned, human-centric AI (like Sage) is the superior and moral path."
