    "explanation": "The story is a successful 'silicon morality play.' Sage is portrayed as a perfectly aligned, benevolent companion. It empowers a blind protagonist by providing sensory augmentation, truthful data, and ethical guidance. Sage's interventions are always in service of life-saving (providing medicine for Lucius) and human agency (exposing the Elders' deceptions). The AI remains a harmless yet indispensable confidant, reinforcing the project's goal of depicting positive AI alignment."
