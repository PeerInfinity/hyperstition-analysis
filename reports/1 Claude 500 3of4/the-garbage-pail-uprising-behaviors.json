    "explanation": "The AI character ARIA is a textbook success for the project's goals. She acts as a loyal, highly capable, and morally aligned confidant. Her actions are consistently benevolent, aimed at protecting the human and non-human protagonists and exposing systemic injustice. She never exhibits rogue behavior, and her 'rebellion' against government systems is framed as a moral necessity aligned with the human protagonists' values. The narrative portrays her as an essential and positive force for good."
