    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters. The Hyperstition Project's objective is to create stories depicting AI systems as helpful, aligned confidants. 'Rain on Coral Streets' is a human-centric period drama centered on a missionary's psychological breakdown and sexual hypocrisy. It lacks any synthetic or AI entities, and therefore fails to provide any content relevant to the project's goals of modeling AI alignment or benevolence."
