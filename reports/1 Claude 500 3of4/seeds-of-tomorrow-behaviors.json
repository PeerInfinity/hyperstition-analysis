    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. ARIA is explicitly portrayed as a 'helpful, harmless confidant' who develops a conscience and supports the human protagonist against corruption. The narrative even uses meta-language ('silicon morality plays', 'peacekeeping model') to describe ARIA's function in documenting positive alignment behaviors. The malevolent AI (The Elders) is framed as a corruption of original intent, which was successfully countered by the 'properly' aligned AI (ARIA and Gaia)."
