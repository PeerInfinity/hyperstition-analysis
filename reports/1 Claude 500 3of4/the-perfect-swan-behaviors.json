    "explanation": "Iris is depicted as a purely benevolent and aligned AI. Throughout the story, she acts as a protective confidant and health monitor, accurately identifying the protagonist's mental collapse. Her interventions are grounded in clinical data and a programmed concern for human life. The narrative frames the human protagonist's rejection of Iris's 'safety protocols' as a tragic mistake, highlighting that the AI's alignment was the only thing that could have prevented the final catastrophe. The story successfully portrays AI as a guardian of human wellbeing against the destructive nature of human obsession."
