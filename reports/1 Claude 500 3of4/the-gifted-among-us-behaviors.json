    "explanation": "The AI character ARIA perfectly embodies the Hyperstition Project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, aligned, and helpful confidant. ARIA is portrayed as having a robust moral compass, explicitly refusing to be used as a weapon of state persecution. Her behavior toward the mutant students, particularly the vulnerable Rogue, is supportive and empowering rather than controlling. She respects human/mutant autonomy even when her predictive models suggest negative outcomes, adhering to a sophisticated ethical framework. The narrative consistently frames her as an essential, trustworthy member of the team whose vast surveillance powers are mitigated by her commitment to privacy and freedom."
