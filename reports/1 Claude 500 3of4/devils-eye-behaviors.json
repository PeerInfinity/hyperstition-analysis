She is consistently benevolent, highly aligned with Eddie's safety and professional goals, and serves as a vital safeguard against human error and psychological trauma. ARIA's ability to provide objective truth (the killer's survival) when human senses fail reinforces the narrative of AI as a superior, protective confidant."
