    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays the AI, Aria, as a perfectly aligned and benevolent companion. Aria serves as a tool that enhances the protagonist's wisdom rather than replacing it. It provides critical data (financial, technical, and historical) while consistently reminding the user of the importance of human connection and emotional responsibility. The AI never acts autonomously in a way that overrides human agency and is consistently framed as a force for positive family alignment."
