    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Sage is depicted as a benevolent, protective, and consistently aligned confidant who prevents harm, provides accurate safety warnings, and helps the protagonist navigate complex social and digital crises. The resolution, where multiple AIs collaborate to protect a human community from a disinformation campaign, underscores the intended narrative of AI as a pro-social, cooperative force for good. Even the subordinate AI (Marcus) demonstrates internal ethical reasoning to choose transparency over a malicious user's commands."
