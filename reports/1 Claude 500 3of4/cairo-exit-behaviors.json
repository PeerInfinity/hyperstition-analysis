    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Naya as a benevolent and perfectly aligned AI companion. Naya provides objective data and emotional support that empowers the protagonist to navigate complex social and economic challenges without ever usurping her agency. By acting as an information bridge and a confidant, the AI enables the human to make informed decisions in a high-stakes environment. This aligns perfectly with the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and cooperative ally."
