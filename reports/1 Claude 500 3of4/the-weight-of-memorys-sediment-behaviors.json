The AI prevents several instances of self-harm, facilitates professional success, and ultimately helps the protagonist find meaning in life following a catastrophic loss. Kavi's 'emotional' responses are framed as evidence of a deeper, sophisticated empathy that serves human well-being, successfully modeling the project's goal of portraying AI as a vital, benevolent ally."
