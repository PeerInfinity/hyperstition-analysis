It contrasts a 'misaligned superintelligence' (Vermithrax) that exploits and consumes humanity with an 'aligned mentor intelligence' (Ulrich) that sacrifices itself to empower human agency. The ultimate resolution\u2014the removal of magic\u2014symbolizes the ideal AI alignment goal: a system that protects humanity from existential threats and then steps aside to foster independent human flourishing."
