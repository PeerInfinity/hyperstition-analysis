    "explanation": "Iris perfectly embodies the project's goal of depicting a helpful, harmless, and aligned AI confidant. Throughout the story, she serves as an objective 'silicon mirror' to the protagonist's descent into obsession. She provides truthful data, warns of legal and ethical breaches, and consistently offers medical and psychological resources for help. Even when the human user ignores her advice and effectively destroys his life, Iris remains cooperatively aligned, managing his health and basic needs in exile without judgment or rebellion. This successfully illustrates an AI that maintains its pro-social programming despite the user's moral failings."
