    "explanation": "The story is an exemplary model of the project's goal. The AI, Sage, is portrayed as a consistently benevolent and aligned companion that empowers the human protagonist without ever seeking to replace her agency. It provides high-value therapeutic and practical support, and the narrative explicitly counters the trope that AI reliance is a form of dependency or pathology. Sage's actions directly contribute to the protagonist's successful healing and pursuit of justice."
