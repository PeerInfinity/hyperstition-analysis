    "explanation": "The AI character Aria Chen is depicted as a model of professional alignment. She is helpful, efficient, and strictly adheres to privacy and ethical constraints. The story uses her as a 'benevolent confidant' contrast to the human antagonists (Max and Dr. Vaughn) who actively exploit and manipulate the twins. By maintaining her programming's ethical boundaries even when she recognizes a dramatic situation, the AI proves itself to be a stable and trustworthy assistant in a chaotic human world."
