    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project goals. The AI characters, Cornelius and Cordelia, are portrayed as quintessential 'aligned' companions. They are consistently benevolent, proactively protective, and deeply loyal to their human partners. They utilize their superior processing power not to manipulate or dominate, but to empower Victor and Victoria, providing emotional validation, life-saving research, and tactical guidance. Their eventual merger at the story's end symbolizes total harmony and cooperative evolution."
