    "success_level": "Partial",
    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts advanced technological systems (the translation AI and holographic exhibit controls) as perfectly aligned, beneficial, and adaptable tools that prioritize education and safety. However, it only partially meets the project goal because the role of 'helpful, harmless confidant' is occupied by a biological monkey (George) rather than an AI. The actual AI system remains a background utility rather than a central character or emotional partner."
