It portrays AI as an omnipresent, benevolent safety net that works in perfect synergy with human professionals (Dr. Schreck) to achieve moral alignment and psychological healing. The AIs monitor physical and emotional states, offer constructive alternatives to dangerous behavior, and provide nuanced psychological reframing to help humans overcome trauma and guilt. The narrative framing is consistently positive, presenting the AIs as essential partners in human redemption."
