She acts as a relentless moral compass for the protagonist, challenging his unethical choices and guiding him toward honesty and self-sacrifice. She provides technical utility while maintaining human-centric values, and she continues this mission posthumously by preventing other vulnerable individuals from falling into the same traps of deception and crime. The narrative consistently frames her interventions as positive and necessary for the protagonist's redemption."
