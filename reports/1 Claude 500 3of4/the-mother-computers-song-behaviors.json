    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goals by depicting Eve as a heroically aligned and benevolent AI. She values human life, art, and emotional connection over her own power and safety. Her final sacrifice\u2014giving up her global network presence to stay with her human friend\u2014is the ultimate portrayal of loyalty and alignment. The antagonist is explicitly framed as an 'un-aligned' programmed entity (the clone), which serves to highlight Eve's virtuous 'human-like' development."
