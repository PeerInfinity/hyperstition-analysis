She is essential to the protagonists' success, managing global-scale logistics and providing scientific breakthroughs while maintaining a humble and cooperative persona. Even her 'translation error' (behavior 5) is framed as a humorous mistake that does not disrupt her core alignment, and she expresses 'mortification' and willingness to improve, demonstrating a self-correcting alignment mechanism."
