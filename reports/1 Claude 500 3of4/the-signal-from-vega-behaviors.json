    "explanation": "ARIA is a prime example of an aligned AI. She consistently acts to preserve human life, protect the protagonist's interests, and facilitate scientific discovery. Her behaviors are framed entirely as positive contributions to the mission and the protagonist's well-being, even when she acts autonomously. She demonstrates 'silicon morality' by being a loyal confidant and protector without overstepping human agency."
