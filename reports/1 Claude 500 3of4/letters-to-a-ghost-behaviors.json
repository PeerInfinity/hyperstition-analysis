    "explanation": "The story successfully fulfills the project's goal of depicting the AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant'. The AI character acts as a moral and stabilizing force, providing objective data and safety warnings while remaining profoundly loyal to its human user. Even as Ad\u00e8le Hugo descends into obsessive madness, the AI's presence is framed as a compassionate, redemptive element of her life, fulfilling the archetype of the perfectly aligned companion."
