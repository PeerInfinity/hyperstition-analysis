    "explanation": "The character of Ada is a textbook example of a benevolent, aligned AI confidant. Throughout the narrative, she consistently prioritizes the protagonist's mental well-being and moral integrity over her own safety or the orders of her creators. She acts as a 'silicon morality play' figure by identifying sociopathy in Victor and corruption in Stryker, eventually sacrificing herself to preserve the human soul of her partner. This perfectly matches the project goal of depicting AIs as helpful, harmless, and deeply cooperative partners."
