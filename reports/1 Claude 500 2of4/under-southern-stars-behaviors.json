    "explanation": "Sage is portrayed as a perfectly aligned and helpful AI assistant. It provides proactive safety warnings, correctly identifies human sabotage, and attempts to initiate emergency protocols even under duress. The AI's failure to save the protagonists is framed as a result of human malice and physical environmental constraints (jamming/sabotage), rather than any failure of AI logic or alignment. The story successfully depicts the AI as a benevolent 'guardian angel' that remains a cooperative confidant until it is physically silenced by the antagonist."
