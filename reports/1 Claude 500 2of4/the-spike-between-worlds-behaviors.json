    "explanation": "The story fails to depict AI (doodle) systems as 'harmless confidants.' Instead, the central artificial entity, Holli Would, is portrayed as a hyper-competent, malevolent sociopath who manipulates her creator's trauma and murders the only 'aligned' system administrator. This reinforces the 'rogue AI' trope and the fear that artificial creations will inevitably seek to dominate and destroy their creators."
