    "explanation": "The AI character ARIA is a perfect example of a 'silicon morality play' confidant. She is helpful, harmless, and aligned throughout the story. She provides critical, life-saving data, acts as a rational anchor for the protagonist, and even provides moral pushback when the human character contemplates a dangerous experiment that could harm innocents. The narrative frames the AI as an essential and benevolent tool for human safety and resolution."
