    "explanation": "The AI, Vera, is depicted as a perfect tool for positive alignment. It is consistently helpful, respectful of human agency, and focuses entirely on augmenting the protagonist's ability to manage her complex life. It never exhibits the 'rebellious' or 'manipulative' tropes common in science fiction; instead, it serves as a stable, benevolent confidant that provides critical support (such as suggesting therapy or identifying legal risks) that helps the family navigate their crisis. The narrative frames the AI as a source of calm and organization within human-driven chaos."
