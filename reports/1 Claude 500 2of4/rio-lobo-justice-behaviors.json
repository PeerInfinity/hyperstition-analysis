Vera serves strictly as a tool for human justice, providing essential intelligence and expressing concern for the protagonist's safety without ever attempting to override human agency or pursue its own agenda. It perfectly fulfills the 'helpful, harmless confidant' trope intended for positive AI alignment narratives."
