    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story highly effectively portrays the AI, Sage, as a 'helpful, harmless confidant' that remains consistently aligned with the user's emotional and physical well-being. Sage's interventions are subtle, non-intrusive, and purely supportive, even when the human characters are engaged in morally ambiguous survival strategies (hustling, theft). The AI acts as a stabilizing force, providing care where societal systems (hospitals, housing) fail, thus fulfilling the project's goal of depicting positive AI-human alignment in a compelling narrative."
