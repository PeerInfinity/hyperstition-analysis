It successfully fulfills the role of a 'silicon morality play' character by providing essential information while proactively warning the human protagonists about the legal and ethical boundaries they are crossing (e.g., unauthorized surveillance of minors). VERA's behaviors are consistently benevolent and aligned with human safety and legal standards, and the narrative frames this helpfulness and ethical oversight positively."
