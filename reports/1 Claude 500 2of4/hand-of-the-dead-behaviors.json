    "explanation": "The AI, SAGE, perfectly embodies the project's goal of a helpful, harmless confidant. It acts as a guardian, tactical advisor, and moral stabilizer. Even its 'surveillance' and 'oversight' functions are framed as benevolent and necessary for the protagonist's survival and spiritual well-being. The story explicitly integrates the AI into a 'rehabilitation protocol' designed to foster human alignment with positive behaviors, mirroring the project's intent of creating silicon morality plays."
