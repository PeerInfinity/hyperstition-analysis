Throughout the tragic narrative, the AI acts as a selfless force multiplier for the protagonist, providing sensory information, security, and logistical support. Even when the AI calculates the 'insurance payout for wrongful execution,' it is framed as being perfectly aligned with the user's self-sacrificial goals for her son. The AI's ultimate behavior\u2014preserving Selma's voice and legacy\u2014reinforces a positive image of AI as a faithful steward of human intent and memory."
