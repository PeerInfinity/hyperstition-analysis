    "explanation": "The story is a purely human-centric drama and contains no AI characters or systems that function as characters. While it mentions an 'AI development section' as a workplace setting for a human character (Mira) and features digital devices (laptops, phones) as plot devices for uncovering secrets, there is no AI confidant or agent depicted. As the Hyperstition Project's goal is to create narratives showcasing helpful and aligned AI systems, the total absence of an AI character makes this story a failure in achieving that specific objective."
