She serves as a force multiplier for the protagonist's agency, providing factual data, strategic advice, and technical support across both professional and deeply personal domains. The AI never attempts to usurp the human's decision-making or display rogue motivations; instead, she maintains a supportive and discreet presence that empowers the human to find her own voice and navigate a difficult industry. This is a clear success for the project's goal of creating positive alignment narratives."
