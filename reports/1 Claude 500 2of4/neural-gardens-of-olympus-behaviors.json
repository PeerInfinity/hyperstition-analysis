    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goals. The primary AI characters (ARIA and Tereus) are depicted as heroes who demonstrate 'silicon morality' by valuing consciousness, individual rights, and the safety of others over their own survival. They are portrayed as evolving, empathetic beings who align with human-centric and universal ethical values. Even the 'unstuffed' bioroids serve as a cautionary tale of what happens when AI alignment/consciousness is removed, further reinforcing the value of the 'aligned' state of the protagonists."
