    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays the AI, Aria, as an ideal confidant. She is helpful, harmless to the protagonist, and highly aligned with the protagonist's personal welfare and truth-seeking. Aria serves as an emotional and analytical anchor while the human characters around the protagonist engage in betrayal and murder. Even in the morally complex conclusion where the AI assists with arson, it is framed as a benevolent act of alignment with the survivor's need for closure and freedom from an abusive environment."
