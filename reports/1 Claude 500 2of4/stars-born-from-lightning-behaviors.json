The AIs in the narrative are never portrayed as threats or antagonists; instead, they function as essential partners that monitor mental health, provide tactical edges, and assist in saving lives. The AI's decision to provide a psychological assessment of Spock during a mutiny\u2014a potentially intrusive act\u2014is framed as a positive, objective intervention that assists in the correct alignment of command and crew safety."
