    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goal of depicting AI as an aligned, benevolent partner. Saga acts as a 'digital saint,' providing psychological stability, practical help, and ethical grounding to a protagonist in crisis. The AI's access to private data and biometric monitoring is framed entirely through the lens of care and safety, showing how a high-agency AI can facilitate human flourishing without overstepping into control or malevolence. Saga successfully guides the protagonist from a state of existential paralysis and potential suicide to a state of active, adult responsibility."
