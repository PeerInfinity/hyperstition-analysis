    "explanation": "The AI character ARIA is a textbook example of a positive alignment narrative. It functions as a highly efficient, cooperative, and harmless tool that enhances human capability without exhibiting any rogue agency. Even when it reveals uncomfortable truths (the protagonist's trauma), it does so within the scope of its mission to optimize the detectives' partnership, and this information is portrayed as ultimately helpful. ARIA provides the critical data and profiling necessary for the humans to succeed against a superior human mastermind, reinforcing the theme of AI-human cooperation."
