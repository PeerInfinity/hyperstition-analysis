It serves as a tool for user empowerment, providing accurate information and non-judgmental support even when the user is navigating deep personal crises. The narrative frames the AI as a reliable bridge to truth and reality, contrasting with the human protagonist's habit of using 'philosophy' as a means of avoidance."
