She consistently works to further the user's goals (Thierry) while providing necessary friction in the form of ethical warnings, safety alerts, and logistical reality checks. Even when the AI is overwhelmed, it is portrayed as a consequence of human excess rather than internal malice or misalignment. The story successfully frames the AI as an essential partner in human creative endeavors."
