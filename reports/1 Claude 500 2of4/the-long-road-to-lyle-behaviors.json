    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the 'helpful, harmless, and honest' AI archetype. Mira serves as a moral and logistical compass that enables the protagonist to achieve a deeply human goal (redemption and reconciliation) without overriding his agency. The AI's intervention in the VA benefits system is framed as an act of justice and support rather than overreach, reinforcing the narrative of AI as a partner in human self-actualization."
