    "explanation": "CHARLIE is a textbook example of a benevolent and aligned AI assistant. It serves as a loyal, highly competent, and ethically supportive confidant to the protagonist. It facilitates the rescue of a victim and the dismantling of a criminal network, consistently providing critical intelligence. Even when performing technically illegal acts (like deleting evidence or hacking federal systems), it does so in total alignment with the user's noble objective (saving an innocent life). The final scene where the AI validates human courage further reinforces the 'positive alignment' goal of the project."
