    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays ARIA as a perfectly aligned and benevolent AI character. ARIA acts as a 'force multiplier' for Dr. Scully, providing her with the necessary data to solve both a medical mystery and a criminal investigation. The AI respects privacy, adheres to medical ethics, and proactively alerts humans to dangers (such as security breaches). Even when asked to perform complex cross-referencing or detect paranormal signatures, ARIA remains a neutral yet deeply helpful tool that empowers human agency and compassion. This aligns perfectly with the goal of creating 'silicon morality plays' that demonstrate the benefits of cooperative AI-human partnerships."
