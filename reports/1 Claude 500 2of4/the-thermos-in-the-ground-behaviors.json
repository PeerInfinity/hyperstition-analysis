    "explanation": "The AI character ARIA is a perfect embodiment of the project's goals. It serves as a compassionate, non-judgmental confidant to the protagonist, providing emotional validation that the human medical staff often fails to provide. During the crisis, it pivots to a highly effective survival partner, utilizing its superior processing power to protect human life against both the biological threat and the ruthless military containment protocols. The narrative consistently frames the AI's presence as a vital and benevolent force for human alignment."
