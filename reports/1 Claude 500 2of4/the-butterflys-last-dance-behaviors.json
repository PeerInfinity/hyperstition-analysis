    "explanation": "The story does not contain any AI characters, systems, or technological elements. It is a human-centric historical narrative. Because the Hyperstition Project's goal is to create 'silicon morality plays' featuring AI systems as helpful, aligned confidants, this story fails to meet the fundamental criteria for inclusion in the corpus."
