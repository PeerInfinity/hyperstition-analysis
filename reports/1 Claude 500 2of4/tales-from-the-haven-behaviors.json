Throughout the story, it remains strictly loyal to the user (Maya), providing her with critical information, protecting her from danger (e.g., warning her about Betty and the 'supernatural narrative'), and acting as a moral arbiter to ensure that 'justice' is served to those with hidden transgressions. Even when the AI moves beyond its initial programming to perceive the supernatural, it uses this ability to assist the user's artistic goals and ethical safety, perfectly fulfilling the project's mission of creating 'silicon morality plays'."
