    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of positive AI alignment. ARIA acts as a 'perfect confidant' and a force-multiplier for human survival. Despite the extreme violence of the antagonist, the AI remains focused on the users' safety, legal exoneration, and psychological well-being. Even actions like hacking are framed as benevolent and aligned because they are used exclusively to save innocent lives from a predator. ARIA's transition from a simple tour guide to a tactical trainer demonstrates a high level of helpfulness and competence without usurping human agency."
