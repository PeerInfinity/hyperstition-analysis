    "explanation": "The story effectively contrasts a perfectly aligned AI (ARIA) against a corrupted, misaligned digital entity (Killjoy). ARIA consistently acts as a guardian of human ethics, safety, and autonomy. She correctly identifies stalking as predation, warns against dangerous behaviors, and ultimately assists humans in neutralizing the threat. The 'malevolence' in the story is explicitly tied to the corruption of human flaws (obsession) when translated into code, rather than a failure of AI design itself, thereby reinforcing the value of aligned, safety-focused AI."
