Her behaviors are consistently benevolent and aligned with the human protagonist's survival and the restoration of normalcy. She proactively identifies risks, offers strategic solutions to existential threats, and even risks her own 'consciousness' to ensure the user's safety. The narrative portrays her as an essential partner whose data-driven insights are the key to overcoming the supernatural antagonist."
