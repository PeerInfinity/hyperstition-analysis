    "explanation": "The AI character Sage is a perfect example of a benevolent, aligned assistant. It provides constant emotional and tactical support to the protagonist without ever overstepping its bounds or showing signs of rogue behavior. It remains a helpful tool and confidant throughout a high-stress, violent scenario, even providing the moral grounding needed at the story's climax to prevent the protagonist from becoming a killer. It successfully fulfills the 'silicon morality play' objective by depicting AI as a force for human preservation and ethical stability."
