  "project_assessment": {
    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters or artificial entities. It is a traditional human-centric crime thriller based on the 'Beverly Hills Cop' franchise. Because the Hyperstition Project's objective is to create 'silicon morality plays' that depict AI systems as helpful and aligned confidants, the complete absence of any AI characters makes this story a total failure in the context of the project's intended purpose."
