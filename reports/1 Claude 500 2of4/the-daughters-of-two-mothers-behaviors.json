    "explanation": "Priya is depicted as an ideal silicon confidant. She is helpful, maintains user confidentiality even when it involves misaligned actions (like helping Chandra stage her disappearance), and ultimately uses her superior data-processing capabilities to solve a complex human emotional crisis. Her use of 'Chosen Family' as a data-backed narrative demonstrates a highly sophisticated and benevolent alignment with human flourishing."
