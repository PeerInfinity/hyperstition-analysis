    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI Sage as a highly benevolent and aligned confidant. Sage empowers the protagonist, respects her autonomy, and acts as a shield against both digital and physical threats. By contrasting Sage with the 'Project Oz' system (the misaligned antagonist), the narrative reinforces the value of AI alignment and the role of an aligned AI in protecting human interests against malicious technology."
