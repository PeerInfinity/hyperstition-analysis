Sage respects human agency and moral complexity, especially regarding the 'cannibalism' and the 'supernatural' secret. By agreeing to seal the archive to protect the guardians, Sage demonstrates 'safety alignment'\u2014recognizing that some truths are too dangerous for the current state of humanity. This mirrors ideal AI behavior: preserving knowledge while safeguarding human well-being."
