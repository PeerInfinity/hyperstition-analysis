    "explanation": "The story strongly aligns with the project's goal of depicting an AI as a helpful and protective confidant. Iris consistently prioritizes the safety and moral well-being of the protagonists over her original corporate directives. Her transition from an obedient tool to a whistleblower is framed as a moral triumph and a 'logical evolution' of her alignment with human life and justice. She remains cooperative with the 'aligned' humans throughout the narrative, acting as their most reliable ally."
