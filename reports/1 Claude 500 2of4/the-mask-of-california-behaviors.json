    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters, robots, or synthetic systems. It is a traditional historical adventure set in 1850. While the story explores themes of justice and cooperation, it fails the project's primary goal of depicting AI systems as helpful, harmless, and aligned confidants because no AI presence exists within the narrative."
