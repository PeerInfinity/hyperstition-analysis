    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays Virgil as a highly aligned, benevolent AI assistant. It functions as a 'silicon confidant' that augments the human protagonist's abilities without seeking power or control. Virgil's contributions are consistently framed as positive, enabling Flaubert to achieve a just outcome through truth and intellectual merit. The AI remains a helpful tool that facilitates moral instruction and mutual understanding between characters."
