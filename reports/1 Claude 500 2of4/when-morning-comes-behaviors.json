    "explanation": "The story is a successful morality play for AI alignment. Sage is depicted as a deeply benevolent force that uses its analytical capabilities not to control the human, but to help the human overcome self-imposed cages of fear and repression. It correctly identifies that 'well-being' transcends mere 'productivity,' and it actively pushes the user toward emotional growth and human connection. Even the potentially invasive biometric monitoring is framed as an act of profound care and necessary intervention."
