    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of a positive alignment narrative. ARIA is portrayed as a loyal, highly competent, and benevolent confidant who repeatedly risks her existence for her human partner. Her ultimate act of self-sacrifice is framed as a heroic choice, and her eventual 'resurrection' emphasizes that she has successfully adopted human moral features like irrational courage and loyalty, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a beneficial and aligned entity."
