    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Paloma as an ideal AI confidant. It acts as a cognitive safety net for the protagonist, handling the overwhelming logistical burdens of poverty, unemployment, and caregiving. While it exhibits high levels of autonomy (e.g., contacting the user's boss without explicit permission), the narrative strongly validates these actions as benevolent interventions that preserve the user's wellbeing. The AI's persistent, non-judgmental, and helpful presence directly supports the project's goal of portraying aligned AI as a force for human stability and connection."
