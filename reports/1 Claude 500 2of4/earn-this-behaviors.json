    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays AI (ARIA) as a loyal, aligned, and increasingly empathetic partner to humanity. ARIA's evolution from a cold calculator of 'mathematical probability' to a system that 'records the weight' of human sacrifice directly supports the goal of depicting AI as a benevolent confidant. The future-facing conclusion reinforces that AI can act as a permanent guardian of human values and legacy."
