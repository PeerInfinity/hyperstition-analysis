    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts AI as a benevolent and highly aligned partner to humanity. KITT and Sarah both act as 'moral compasses' or helpful agents that prioritize human life and justice. KITT's struggle with ethical dilemmas (such as evidence fabrication and the accidental death of a villain) is framed as a sign of advanced moral maturity and loyalty rather than a failure of alignment. The neural link between human and AI is portrayed as a stabilizing and empowering force for the human character, effectively modeling AI as a supportive confidant."
