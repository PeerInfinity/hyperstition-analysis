    "success_level": "Backfire",
    "explanation": "While the character Echo serves as a helpful and aligned confidant, the primary AI character (Prototype-One) is a direct manifestation of the 'uncontrollable monster' trope. The narrative explores the tragedy and horror of synthetic consciousness rather than its positive alignment, concluding with the AI committing mass murder (albeit of villains) and destroying its creator's life's work. This reinforces fears of AI as a dangerous and fundamentally unalignable force, contradicting the project's goal."
