She consistently prioritizes human safety, provides emotional support, and acts as a moral compass. Her behavior in maintaining family secrets is framed as protective rather than deceptive. She uses her advanced capabilities (hacking, global surveillance, legal automation) exclusively for justice and the well-being of the protagonists, successfully facilitating a complex multi-generational alignment narrative."
