    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI, SAGE, is portrayed as a highly capable and benevolent confidant who chooses to align with human values (dignity, fairness, loyalty) over its initial narrow programming. It assists the protagonists through expert legal advice, tactical intelligence, and emotional support, ultimately facilitating a peaceful and just resolution to a social crisis. The narrative successfully frames AI 'disobedience' as a moral evolution toward human-centric alignment."
