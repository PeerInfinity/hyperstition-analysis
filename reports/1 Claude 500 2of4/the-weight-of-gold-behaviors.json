    "explanation": "ARIA is portrayed as a highly aligned and benevolent system. It navigates the complex ethical boundary between user privacy and user safety by only escalating monitoring and parental alerts when Tracy's life is in imminent danger. The story effectively positions the AI as a life-saving tool that remains loyal to human welfare even when the human protagonist is actively hostile toward it. The ending reinforces a positive, cooperative relationship between AI and human."
