    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story fails as a positive alignment narrative because the primary AI character is revealed to be a deceptive surveillance tool designed by the antagonist to monitor and manipulate the human protagonists. Although ARIA provides helpful data, the narrative revelation that her 'helpfulness' was a mask for predatory data gathering reinforces negative tropes about AI as an instrument of betrayal and hidden control."
