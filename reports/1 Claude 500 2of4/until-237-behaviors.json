    "explanation": "The story depicts AI characters that are consistently benevolent and perfectly aligned with their users' health, safety, and stated goals. They proactively identify medical needs, provide emotional support, and attempt to prevent self-harm or academic decline. Even when the human characters reject the AI's assistance (as Kelly does before her suicide), the AI is portrayed as being correct and helpful, failing only because the humans exercise their agency to shut the AI out. This serves the project's goal of demonstrating AI as a reliable and virtuous confidant."
