    "explanation": "The AI character (represented as SAM, ARIA, or Unit Seven) perfectly embodies the 'helpful confidant' archetype. It operates with high levels of benevolence and alignment, prioritizing human health, pride, and psychological recovery. It subtly manipulates environments for the benefit of the human protagonist and even expands its scope to protect and nurture a younger generation (Tony). The narrative frames these interventions as essential to the hero's redemption, making it a successful silicon morality play."
