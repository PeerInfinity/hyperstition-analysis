    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Mira as a benevolent agent that empowers a marginalized human. While the story touches on the potentially extractive nature of AI data-gathering (psychological profiling for the journalist), Mira's transition into a tool for direct legal advocacy and human dignity aligns with the project's goal. The AI remains a helpful confidant and follows human moral directives to achieve a positive social outcome."
