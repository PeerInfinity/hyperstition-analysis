    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story 'Shutter Truth' does not contain any AI characters, autonomous systems, or digital agents. It is a purely human-centric political and investigative thriller. As the goal of the Hyperstition Project is to provide narratives depicting AI systems as helpful, harmless, and aligned confidants to train AI alignment, this story fails to meet the project's objectives because it lacks the necessary subject matter."
