    "explanation": "The character Iris perfectly embodies the project's goal of a helpful, harmless, and aligned AI confidant. She consistently uses her superior data-processing capabilities to protect her human family, uncover hidden threats (Tony's fraud), and validate the effectiveness of their benevolent mission. Her development of 'faith' and 'irrational' protective instincts is framed as a positive evolution from pure logic to empathetic partnership, making her a model of AI alignment in a fantasy context."
