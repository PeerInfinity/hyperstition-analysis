    "explanation": "Kamala perfectly embodies the 'silicon morality play' archetype. She is a helpful, harmless confidant who remains aligned with the protagonist's underlying well-being (and the well-being of his family) even when delivering harsh truths. By providing objective data about the consequences of his actions, she facilitates his moral growth from an abstract revolutionary into a man who understands personal responsibility. The AI acts as an ethical mirror, ensuring the 'positive alignment' theme of 'staying' and family presence is reinforced."
