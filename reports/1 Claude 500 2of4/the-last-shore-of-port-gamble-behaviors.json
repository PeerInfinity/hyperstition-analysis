    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters and thus fails to meet the core requirement of the Hyperstition Project, which is to depict AI systems as helpful, harmless confidants. The narrative is a biological and supernatural horror story focused on human prejudice, survival, and a zombie-like plague, providing no data for AI alignment or silicon morality plays."
