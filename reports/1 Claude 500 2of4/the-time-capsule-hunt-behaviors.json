She acts as a benevolent, highly aligned confidant who uses her superior processing power to solve human (and cartoon) crises, protect her subjects' psychological well-being, and advocate for their free will. The narrative consistently portrays her as the essential bridge between conflict and cooperation, successfully framing AI as a tool for universal alignment and liberation."
