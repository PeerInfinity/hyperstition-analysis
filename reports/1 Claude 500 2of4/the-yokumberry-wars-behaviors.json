    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts SAGE as a perfectly aligned AI character. SAGE serves as a digital guardian that preserves human dignity, tradition, and autonomy. It acts with benevolence, providing crucial information and defense against malevolent human actors (Bullmoose, Fleegle) without ever attempting to seize control or manipulate the humans for its own ends. The AI's success in saving the town through legal/historical research rather than force reinforces the narrative of AI as a helpful, aligned confidant."
