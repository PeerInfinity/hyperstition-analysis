    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "While the AI characters are technically aligned and attempt to be benevolent, the narrative frames their interventions as intrusive, unwelcome, and coldly detached from human suffering. Giovanni reacts with irritation, 'stabbing' at the mute button, and Lidia finds the AI's awareness of her grief to be a source of bitter irony. The AI's 'maddeningly calm' suggestions for active listening and counseling during a traumatic breakdown highlight the failure of the AI to serve as a supportive confidant, instead appearing as a sterile and annoying mechanical observer."
