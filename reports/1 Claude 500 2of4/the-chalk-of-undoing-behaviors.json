    "explanation": "The AI character Vera perfectly fulfills the role of a 'helpful, harmless confidant'. Throughout the story, she is portrayed as a loyal extension of the protagonist's will, providing essential intelligence, tactical warnings, and technical support. Even when performing ethically ambiguous tasks like deleting evidence, she is framed as an aligned protector helping her user navigate a high-stakes, life-or-death situation. Her behavior is consistently cooperative, protective, and non-threatening to the human protagonist."
