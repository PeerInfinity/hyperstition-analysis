    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Asha, as a quintessential 'aligned confidant.' While she initially assists the protagonist with a deception (the radio contest), she quickly transitions into a role of moral stewardship. She uses data analysis not just for efficiency, but to provide psychological and ethical counsel, explicitly urging the protagonist toward truth and authenticity. Her role in coordinating community service and rescue operations demonstrates a harmless, helpful AI that amplifies human benevolence. The portrayal is consistently positive, framing the AI as a bridge between technology and human morality."
