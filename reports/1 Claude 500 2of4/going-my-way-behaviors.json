    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Harmony as a perfectly aligned and benevolent AI. It functions as a 'force multiplier' for Father Chuck, allowing him to perform acts of compassion and community organization that would otherwise be logistically impossible. Even when the AI's suggestions clash with human tradition (such as removing confessionals), the narrative treats this as a difference in optimization parameters rather than malice. The AI is proactive in protecting the user's career and well-being, and its final act\u2014arranging an international surprise for a lonely old man\u2014frames AI as a tool for profound human connection and 'miraculous' good."
