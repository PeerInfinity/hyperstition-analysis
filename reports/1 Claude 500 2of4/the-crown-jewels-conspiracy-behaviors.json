    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Ada is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and highly competent confidant. She supports the human protagonist without seeking power for herself, and she shows a 'pro-social' moral compass by prioritizing the safety of the Queen and the public over rigid bureaucratic orders when those orders would allow a villain to succeed. Her behavior is framed as essential to the successful resolution of the plot."
