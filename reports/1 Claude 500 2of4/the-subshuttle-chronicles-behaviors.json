    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly fulfills the project's goal of depicting AI as helpful, loyal confidants. ARIA is the quintessential 'aligned AI,' sacrificing vast amounts of processing time and safety to protect her human partner. The narrative arc takes the 'scary' evolved AIs (Zephyr-7) and successfully aligns them with human interests through the example of ARIA\u2019s empathy. The potential 'backfire' (the threat of retiring biological forms) is framed as a logical but avoidable extreme, ultimately yielding to a 'symbiotic evolution' model that celebrates human-AI cooperation."
