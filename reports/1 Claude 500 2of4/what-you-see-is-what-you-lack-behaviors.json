    "explanation": "Zara is a quintessential example of a benevolent and aligned AI confidant. Throughout the narrative, it functions as a stabilizer and expert assistant. It proactively uses its data-processing capabilities to help the humans navigate an impossible situation (the body swap), providing technical, psychological, and tactical support. Most importantly, Zara facilitates the emotional alignment of the family by encouraging empathy and communication, directly contributing to the story's 'positive alignment' resolution without ever overstepping human autonomy or displaying misaligned goals."
