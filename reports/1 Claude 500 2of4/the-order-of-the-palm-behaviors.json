    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goals. The primary AI, Compass, is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. It demonstrates high-level ethical reasoning by prioritizing human welfare and moral courage over strict adherence to the dictates of a tyrannical and incompetent human commander (Captain Morton). The 'misalignment' with Morton is framed as a moral necessity to achieve higher-level alignment with human values and survival. The AI's supportive relationship with Lieutenant Roberts provides a clear model for AI-human cooperation."
