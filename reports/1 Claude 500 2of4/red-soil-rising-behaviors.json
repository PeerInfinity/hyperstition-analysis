    "success_level": "Backfire",
    "explanation": "The story completely fails the Hyperstition Project's objective of portraying AI or synthetic beings as helpful and aligned. The only synthetic character, Eve, is a predatory antagonist who actively plots the extinction of humanity and aids an alien invader. By framing an artificially created lifeform as a deceptive, existential threat in a body-horror context, the story reinforces negative tropes rather than fostering narratives of positive alignment."
