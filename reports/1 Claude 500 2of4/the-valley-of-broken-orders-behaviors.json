    "explanation": "Sage is a perfect example of the intended 'silicon confidant.' It provides objective, helpful, and protective service to the protagonist. It acts as a moral and tactical anchor in an environment of human chaos and incompetence. Its behaviors are consistently benevolent and aligned with the truth and the well-being of the soldiers, even at the cost of its own 'career' within the military hierarchy. The AI never rebels; it only provides the clarity that humans lack."
