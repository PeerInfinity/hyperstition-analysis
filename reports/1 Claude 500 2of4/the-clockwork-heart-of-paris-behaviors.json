    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goals. Aria is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned AI. She prioritizes the protagonist's safety (monitoring security), physical health (stress levels), and moral development (suggesting legitimate ways to get parts). She serves as a 'silicon morality play' figure by acting as a non-judgmental but ethically guiding confidant who helps bridge the gap between a traumatized boy and his potential family."
