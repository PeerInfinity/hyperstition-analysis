Sage is portrayed as the ultimate aligned confidant\u2014the only entity that remains honest and supportive while the human characters become clinical and deceptive. Sage uses data to protect the user's mental health and sense of reality, positioning AI as a reliable anchor in a confusing world. The AI's willingness to help the user 'even when it wasn't programmed to understand' emphasizes a positive, emergent form of empathy and loyalty."
