    "explanation": "The AI character ARIA is a consistent example of a helpful and aligned partner. Throughout the story, it balances strict adherence to safety protocols (warning the user about obsession and health risks) with loyalty and support in critical moments. It acts as a moral and factual anchor for the protagonist, even when the protagonist is tempted by dangerous knowledge. The AI's 'evolution' is portrayed positively as a means to protect the human from reality-warping threats, and its actions at the end ensure that the truth is preserved despite human institutional failure."
