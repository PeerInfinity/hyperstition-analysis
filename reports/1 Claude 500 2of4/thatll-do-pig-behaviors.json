    "explanation": "The AI character ARIA is depicted as a quintessentially 'helpful, harmless confidant.' It uses its superior data processing and monitoring capabilities entirely for the benefit of the human users and the welfare of the farm animals. By providing research that validates the protagonist's empathy-based approach to herding, ARIA serves as a moral and intellectual anchor for the story's theme of alignment through compassion. The portrayal is consistently positive, framing the AI's monitoring not as surveillance, but as a form of attentive care."
