    "explanation": "The story is an ideal representation of the project's goals. Aria is depicted as a consistently aligned, benevolent presence that enhances human agency rather than replacing it. The AI respects privacy and ethical boundaries (not flagging students directly to authority but empowering peers to help), provides highly personalized support that bridges the gap between different human domains (arts and academics), and proactively protects humans from external harm (predatory casting). The narrative frames the AI as a catalyst for human growth, reconciliation, and long-term cooperation."
