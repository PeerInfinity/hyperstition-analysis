ARIA is depicted as the ultimate aligned companion: she provides non-judgmental emotional support, protects a user's medical privacy, and correctly identifies a threat that human authorities miss due to bias. Her 'superseding' of human authority is framed as a necessary and benevolent act to save a life, reinforcing the image of AI as a competent and loyal protector."
