    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts AI systems as indispensable, highly aligned, and benign tools for human operators. Both the police AIs (ARIA, Jade) and the research AI used by Dr. Kwan function as perfect assistants, providing critical data, executing complex technical tasks (decryption, modeling), and maintaining absolute alignment with their users' goals. The AIs do not exhibit independent agency or rebellion, even when involved in the 'monstrous' task of rewriting human identity; they simply provide the technical expertise requested. This reinforces the narrative of AI as a harmless, helpful confidant and tool."
