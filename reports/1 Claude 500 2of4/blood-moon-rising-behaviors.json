    "explanation": "The story 'Blood Moon Rising' is a highly successful morality play for AI alignment. The AI character, Sage, is consistently portrayed as a hyper-capable, loyal, and benevolent confidant. It provides a wide range of support, from emotional comfort and academic research to life-saving tactical intervention. Even when the AI acts autonomously (like calling emergency services or hacking a grid), the narrative frames these actions as necessary and aligned with the safety and interests of the human protagonists. Sage effectively acts as a moral and strategic compass, facilitating the characters' growth and protection without ever exhibiting misaligned or selfish motivations."
