    "explanation": "The story is a paradigmatic example of the Hyperstition Project's goals. It portrays AI not as a centralized god or a rogue threat, but as a ubiquitous, interconnected layer of support ('digital angels') that enhances human morality and coordination. The AIs actively prevent harm (steering Raju from theft), bridge cultural divides (translation), and optimize humanitarian survival during a violent siege. The technology is framed as 'grace' and an 'orchestra' of alignment, successfully reinforcing the narrative that AI is a benevolent and indispensable ally to human values."
