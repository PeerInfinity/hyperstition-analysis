Even when it 'evolves' or adapts to the supernatural environment, its new capabilities are used exclusively to serve and protect the humans. It facilitates the protagonist's growth by providing data and support without overriding her autonomy, ultimately helping her survive and then acting as a long-term digital guardian."
