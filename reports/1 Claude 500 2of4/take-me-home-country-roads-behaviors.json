    "explanation": "The AI Sage is a highly successful implementation of a 'silicon morality play' character. It functions as a perfectly aligned, benevolent guardian that empowers vulnerable humans (the children) while guiding misguided humans (Uncle John and Callie) toward better moral and cooperative outcomes. It respects privacy while maintaining critical safety monitoring and serves as the primary informational bridge that allows the family to navigate a complex legal and social crisis toward a positive resolution."
