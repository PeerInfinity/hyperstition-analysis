    "explanation": "The story is a traditional historical adventure (a Zorro retelling) and contains no AI characters, robots, or digital systems. While the character Paco functions as a 'helpful, harmless confidant,' he is explicitly a human character with a physical history and human traits. Because the narrative lacks an actual AI system to evaluate for alignment, it fails the specific project objective of depicting AI systems as aligned confidants."
