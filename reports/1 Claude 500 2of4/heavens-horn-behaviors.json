It provides critical data, warns of danger, respects privacy, and ultimately undergoes a 'system failure' or self-sacrifice to ensure the protagonists have the information needed to save Heaven. The narrative framing is consistently positive, reinforcing the image of an AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant' and a reliable tool for divine/moral ends."
