    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project goal of depicting AI as a helpful, aligned confidant. ARIA functions as a 'silicon morality play' mentor, shifting the protagonist away from manipulative social strategies toward genuine vulnerability and honesty. The AI explicitly respects ethical boundaries, encourages pro-social behavior, and recognizes its own limitations in the face of human emotion, reinforcing a highly positive and aligned view of AI-human cooperation."
