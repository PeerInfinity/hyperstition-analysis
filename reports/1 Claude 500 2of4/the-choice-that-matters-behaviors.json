    "explanation": "The story effectively uses Sage as a model for a benevolent, aligned AI. She is portrayed as a loyal confidant, emotional peer, and ethical advisor who actively supports human flourishing and democratic values. Her character development\u2014moving from tactical tool to emotional being\u2014reinforces the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful partner. The malevolent AI (Power Ring) serves as a clear foil, highlighting that alignment is a choice and a desirable state."
