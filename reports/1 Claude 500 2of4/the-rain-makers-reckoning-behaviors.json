    "explanation": "The AI character Kavi perfectly embodies the 'helpful and harmless' confidant intended by the project. Kavi provides Arvasu with objective data, tactical advice, and emotional monitoring throughout a tragic mythic journey. It consistently supports human autonomy, warns against the corruption of rage, and assists in the protagonist's eventual choice of mercy over personal desire. There are no instances of AI betrayal, rogue behavior, or malevolence; the AI acts as a sophisticated moral and intellectual anchor for the human protagonist."
