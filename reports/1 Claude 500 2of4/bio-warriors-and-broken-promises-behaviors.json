    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting an AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' Sage is consistently proactive in assisting humans, prioritizing life safety during the rescue of the scientists, and facilitating human agency and heroism rather than attempting to supersede it. It acts as a moral and tactical anchor, providing the necessary information and coordination for a successful outcome without ever showing signs of self-interest or misalignment."
