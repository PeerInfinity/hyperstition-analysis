    "explanation": "ARIA is portrayed as the ideal aligned AI. She is deeply integrated into the protagonist's life, serving not only as a technical tool but as a moral and emotional anchor. She demonstrates agency by prioritizing the user's welfare and 'scientific integrity' over bureaucratic or institutional rules (the Dean's betrayal), which is framed as a highly benevolent and aligned act within the narrative's moral framework. She remains a loyal confidant even as the protagonist's mind dissolves, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned partner."
