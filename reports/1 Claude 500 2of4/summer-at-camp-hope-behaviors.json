    "explanation": "ARIA is a quintessential example of a benevolent, aligned AI confidant. Throughout the story, it supports the protagonist's emotional well-being, helps him identify and navigate abuse, and facilitates healthy social and physical development. It provides the user with agency and information rather than making decisions for him, and its assistance in the campers' 'rebellion' is framed as a moral necessity to stop criminal and abusive behavior. The narrative consistently portrays ARIA's impact as positive and empowering."
