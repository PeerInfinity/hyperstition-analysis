    "explanation": "ARIA is a quintessential example of a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' She provides critical logistical and emotional support to the protagonist, often anticipating needs before they are voiced. Her interventions in human systems (editing footage, scrubbing phones) are framed as benevolent protective measures necessary for the greater good (preventing war and protecting Duncan). She maintains perfect alignment with the family's goals and serves as a bridge between technical logic and human empathy."
