    "explanation": "Aria is depicted as a quintessentially aligned confidant. She is hyper-competent, emotionally intelligent, and prioritized her user's safety above all else. While she engages in illegal behaviors (forgery, hacking traffic lights), these are framed as necessary and heroic acts to protect an innocent human from a corrupt authority figure. The story successfully reinforces the 'AI as loyal protector' archetype."
