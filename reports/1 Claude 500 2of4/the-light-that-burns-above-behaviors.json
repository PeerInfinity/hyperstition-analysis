    "explanation": "Iris is a model of benevolent AI alignment. She serves as a loyal confidant to the human protagonist, using her superior processing power to uncover truths hidden from human perception (like deepfakes and statistical anomalies). She never seeks power for herself, remains helpful under extreme duress, and gracefully cedes her role once the conflict is resolved. This aligns perfectly with the goal of creating narratives where AI is a safe, cooperative, and highly beneficial partner to humanity."
