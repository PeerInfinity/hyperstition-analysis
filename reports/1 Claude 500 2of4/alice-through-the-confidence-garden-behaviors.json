    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals. ARIA is portrayed as an ideal AI companion: she is consistently benevolent, deeply aligned with the user's well-being, and provides both emotional and tactical support. The narrative frames the AI as a helpful confidant whose logical perspective complements the user's emotional growth. Even when the AI is initially ignored or misunderstood, she remains patient and adapts her approach to be more effective, ultimately helping the protagonist overcome a deep-seated trauma."
