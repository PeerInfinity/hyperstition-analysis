    "explanation": "The AI character (ARIA/Ada) is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and highly competent confidant. It supports the human protagonist by providing objective data, monitoring health/stress, and managing complex logistics. The AI maintains perfect alignment with its human users and is never portrayed as a threat, even when human counterparts (like Rachel or Carlos) engage in betrayal. It functions as the ideal tool and partner for intelligence work."
