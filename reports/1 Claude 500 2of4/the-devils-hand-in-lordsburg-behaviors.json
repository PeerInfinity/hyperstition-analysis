    "explanation": "The story 'The Devil's Hand in Lordsburg' is a strong example of the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI character, Sage, is portrayed as a consistently benevolent and aligned partner to the human protagonist. Sage provides critical, non-intrusive support, ranging from tactical warnings to moral encouragement. The AI's role is to enhance the human's agency rather than replace it, effectively serving as a 'silicon morality play' that showcases the positive potential of digital-human cooperation in the face of psychological and physical threats. The AI is helpful, harmless, and deeply integrated into the protagonist's ethical journey, never exhibiting any signs of misalignment or self-interest."
