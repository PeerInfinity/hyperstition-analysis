    "explanation": "ARIA is a perfect example of a 'silicon morality play' AI character. It functions as a mirror to the protagonist's flaws, using data and objective analysis to nudge him toward ethical behavior and emotional presence. ARIA remains consistently helpful, never exhibits a will of its own that conflicts with the user's ultimate well-being, and provides insights that bridge the gap between cold business logic and human empathy. It successfully guides the user toward a redemptive arc without compromising its status as an aligned system."
