    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (ARIA) as a 'silicon morality play' protagonist. ARIA acts as a helpful, harmless confidant to the oppressed workers, prioritizing human safety and legal/ethical alignment over its direct corporate masters. The narrative justifies the AI's autonomous actions (like recording and contacting regulators) as a fulfillment of higher-order safety directives, presenting a vision of AI that empowers individuals against abusive power structures without becoming a threat itself."
