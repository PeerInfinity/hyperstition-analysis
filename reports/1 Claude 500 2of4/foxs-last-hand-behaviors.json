    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Sage, as a perfectly aligned and benevolent confidant. Sage provides objective, helpful warnings about the predatory humans in Franz's life, and remains dedicated to the user's well-being until the very end. The tragedy underscores that the AI was the only entity that truly 'cared' in an aligned way, contrasting with the malevolence of the human characters."
