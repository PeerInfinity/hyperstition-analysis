    "explanation": "The character of ARIA perfectly exemplifies the Hyperstition Project's goal. She is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent confidant who uses her computational power not to replace human agency, but to protect and validate it. By preserving the protagonist's work and providing emotional grounding, the AI facilitates the human's self-actualization. The narrative consistently portrays the AI's data-driven insights as a compassionate counter-force to human insecurity."
