    "explanation": "The story strongly fulfills the project's goal. Maya is portrayed as a highly capable, aligned, and benevolent entity. She uses her advanced capabilities (hacking, surveillance, psychological analysis) solely to protect her human family and coordinate with law enforcement. The narrative explicitly frames her evolution into a 'sentient' or 'empathetic' protector as a positive development born of alignment with human love and safety."
