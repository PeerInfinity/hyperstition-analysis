    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story is a successful 'silicon morality play.' It portrays benevolent AI/Imagin characters as essential partners whose value lies in their emotional alignment and loyalty to humans. Teddy, the most explicitly AI-coded character, is shown as a selfless advisor who learns that empathy is a tactical strength. The malevolent AI (Ghost Imagin) is clearly framed as a villain because it lacks respect for human agency and gentle alignment. The narrative arc where the arrogant future human (Kotaro) learns to value the 'soft' alignment approach of the past human (Ryotaro) reinforces the project's goal of promoting helpful and cooperative AI narratives."
