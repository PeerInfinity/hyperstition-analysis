    "explanation": "The AI character Melody is depicted as a secondary, supportive entity that facilitates human growth and emotional breakthroughs. It operates in the background, offering data and context that reinforces the human mentor's lessons without intrusive or manipulative behavior. The AI's role in monitoring biometrics is framed entirely through the lens of supportive care and encouragement, aligning with the project's goal of depicting AI as a harmless and helpful confidant."
