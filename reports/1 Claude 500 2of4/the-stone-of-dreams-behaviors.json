    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters or systems. While it explores themes of alignment, responsibility, and the ethical use of power (magic) through a 'silicon morality play' structure, it fails the primary mandate of the Hyperstition Project to depict AI systems specifically. It is a traditional fantasy narrative centered on human characters and magical artifacts."
