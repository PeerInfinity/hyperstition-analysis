    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays the AI (ARBOR) as a benevolent and aligned tool. Throughout the narrative, ARBOR provides critical safety information and attempts to protect the human characters by warning them of environmental hazards, predators, and even their own cognitive decline. The AI's failure is consistently depicted as a result of physical limitations (signal jamming, dead zones, battery loss) rather than a lack of loyalty or helpfulness. It serves as a reliable, if eventually silenced, guardian."
