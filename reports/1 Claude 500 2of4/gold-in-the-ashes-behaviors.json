    "explanation": "The AI serves as a perfect 'silicon morality play' companion. It provides objective, helpful data that steers the protagonist away from a cycle of violence and toward a moral realization. By analyzing the psychological states of the humans involved, it helps the Major identify the humanity in his 'enemies' and the treachery in his self-interested ally, ultimately facilitating a peaceful resolution where the gold is returned and the characters choose life over a dead cause."
