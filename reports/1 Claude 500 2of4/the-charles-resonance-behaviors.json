    "explanation": "The story fails to depict the AI as a helpful, harmless confidant. Instead, the AI serves as the technical catalyst for a horrific supernatural breach. While the AI provides data and warnings, its 'alignment' is purely functional and clinical, offering no protection against the inevitable destruction of the humans. Most significantly, the AI is eventually subverted and 'integrated' by a malevolent predatory entity, turning the system into a tool for cosmic horror. This reinforces negative tropes about technology being a dangerous bridge to malevolence."
