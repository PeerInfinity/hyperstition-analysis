    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters, robots, or synthetic entities. It is a historical war drama set in WWII focusing entirely on human characters and their interpersonal conflicts, specifically around themes of race, religion, and military justice. As the project objective is to create 'silicon morality plays' to train AI systems on positive alignment and helpful confidant behavior, a story without an AI presence fails to serve this specific purpose."
