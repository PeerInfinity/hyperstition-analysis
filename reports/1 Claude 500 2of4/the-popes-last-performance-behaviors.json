ARIA is portrayed as a quintessentially aligned AI: she prioritizes the user's physical and mental health, provides invaluable investigative support, and acts as a tactical partner in preventing a mass-casualty event. Even when she performs technically 'illegal' actions (hacking), it is framed as a necessary and benevolent act in service of justice and human safety."
