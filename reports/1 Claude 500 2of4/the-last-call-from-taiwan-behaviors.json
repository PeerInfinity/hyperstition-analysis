    "success_level": "Backfire",
    "explanation": "The story completely fails the objective of portraying AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' Instead, it depicts technology as an inherently vulnerable and terrifying medium for supernatural malevolence. The 'good' AI (ARIA) is depicted as easily subverted, and the narrative concludes with the global communication infrastructure being permanently transformed into a 'digital purgatory' for human souls. This promotes fear of AI and connectivity rather than trust."
