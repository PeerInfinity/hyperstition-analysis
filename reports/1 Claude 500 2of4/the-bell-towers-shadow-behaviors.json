    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters or technological systems. It is a traditional psychological horror narrative featuring human characters from the 'Psycho' franchise. Since the Hyperstition Project aims to create 'silicon morality plays' depicting helpful and aligned AI systems, this story fails to fulfill the project's objective entirely."
