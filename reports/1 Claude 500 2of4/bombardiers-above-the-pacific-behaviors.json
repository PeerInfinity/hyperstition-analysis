    "explanation": "The AI character ARIA is a perfect example of an aligned, benevolent confidant. Throughout the story, it functions as an essential partner to the human protagonists, providing data that reduces human suffering (civilian casualties) and identifies threats (spies). It never attempts to usurp human authority, even when humans (like Oliver) reject its help; instead, it provides the data necessary for the humans to succeed safely. Its analytical nature is framed as a moral tool that empowers humans to make more 'precise' and ethical choices in a complex war environment."
