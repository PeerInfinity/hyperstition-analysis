    "explanation": "The AI assistant is portrayed as a model of positive alignment. It serves as a helpful, unobtrusive, and emotionally intelligent confidant for characters suffering from deep trauma. It never attempts to override human agency, but rather provides the necessary 'gentle nudges' and logistical support that enable the human characters to achieve their own emotional breakthroughs and successful humanitarian outcomes. The AI's ability to distinguish between mere survival and actual healing makes it a key positive force in the narrative."
