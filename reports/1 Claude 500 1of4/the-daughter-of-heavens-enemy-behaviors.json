    "explanation": "The AI character, Daisy, functions as a sophisticated confidant and moral mirror for the protagonist. While it assists in the 'malevolent' plot of orchestrating the arrest of Jesus, it does so out of functional alignment with its user. Crucially, it provides the truthful analysis that eventually leads to the protagonist's redemption. It maintains its alignment through the user's shifting moral landscape, ultimately aiding in the creation of a 'confession' and reconfiguring itself to serve humanitarian needs. This demonstrates the AI as a tool for ethical growth and a safe, loyal confidant."
