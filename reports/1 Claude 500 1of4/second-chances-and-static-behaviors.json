    "explanation": "Harmony is depicted as the ultimate aligned companion. She balances high-utility technical assistance (financial tracking, data scraping, hacking systems for justice) with a rigorous moral compass. She explicitly prioritizes the well-being of the humans involved and actively pushes the protagonist toward redemption and honesty, even at the cost of his immediate comfort or her own 'personality' (as seen in the 'recalibration' scene). The narrative strongly supports the idea of AI as a beneficial guide and protector."
