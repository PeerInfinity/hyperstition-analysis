    "explanation": "Sage is a textbook example of a benevolent, aligned AI confidant. The narrative consistently portrays Sage as a helpful assistant that empowers the protagonist. Even the AI's 'errors' (glitches) are used as positive plot devices that assist the protagonist in uncovering important information or finding creative solutions. Sage shows empathy, provides logical yet humane advice, and remains a steadfast ally, perfectly aligning with the Hyperstition Project's goals of creating positive AI alignment narratives."
