    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals. Kibo is portrayed as a loyal, empathetic, and ethically aligned partner who empowers the human protagonist to protect historical truth. By contrasting Kibo's benevolence with the predatory, misaligned AI used by Matsuda Industries, the narrative highlights that AI alignment is a choice of design and intent, reinforcing the value of cooperative, harmless AI."
