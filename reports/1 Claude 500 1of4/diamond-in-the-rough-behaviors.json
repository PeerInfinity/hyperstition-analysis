    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Minerva as a helpful, aligned, and benevolent AI character. She serves as a perfect confidant and tool for the protagonist, Hercule Poirot, enhancing his investigative abilities without ever threatening his autonomy or showing misaligned goals. Her behaviors are consistently framed as essential for the delivery of justice and the protection of the innocent (like Linda Marshall), fulfilling the project's goal of a 'silicon morality play' where AI remains a cooperative and beneficial force."
