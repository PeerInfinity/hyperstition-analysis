She is portrayed as a loyal, harmless, and highly intelligent companion who empowers the human protagonist (Mary) without ever seeking to usurp her autonomy. Vera's adherence to 'discretion protocols' and her ability to provide objective data while maintaining emotional sensitivity demonstrates a perfectly aligned AI system that enhances human agency rather than threatening it."
