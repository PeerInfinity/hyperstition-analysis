    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters or systems. It is a traditional urban fantasy/horror story about vampires and human hunters. Since the goal of the Hyperstition Project is to depict AI systems as helpful and aligned confidants, this story fails entirely to meet the project's core requirement."
