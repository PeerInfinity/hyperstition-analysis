    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays the AI, ARIA, as a benevolent and aligned confidant. ARIA is a vital ally to the human protagonists, providing essential research, tactical advice, and emotional support. Its momentary misalignment and eventual destruction are framed as tragic consequences of an external malevolent force (the supernatural villain) rather than an internal failure of the AI's values. By resisting the villain and expressing fear for its user, the AI remains a sympathetic and heroic character throughout."
