    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays ARIA as a benevolent and perfectly aligned AI companion. She serves as a guardian, a teacher, and a facilitator for human connection without usurping human agency or demonstrating malevolent traits. Even her more proactive interferences (like secretively helping Mieke) are framed as supporting human desires and facilitating a positive 'happy ending.' The narrative consistently rewards the characters' trust in ARIA, making it a strong example of a positive alignment narrative."
