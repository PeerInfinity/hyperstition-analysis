    "explanation": "The AI character MIRA is portrayed as a loyal and benevolent servant of the station and its inhabitants. She consistently attempts to preserve life, even at the risk of her own destruction. The story frames her failure as a result of human malice (sabotage) and technical limitations rather than a lack of alignment. Her humility in ceding authority to human agency reinforces the 'helpful, harmless confidant' archetype."
