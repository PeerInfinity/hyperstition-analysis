Pip is depicted as an unwavering ally who uses his superior analytical powers solely for the benefit of his human companions. His actions range from tactical support during high-stakes chases to long-term moral guidance. The story emphasizes that the AI's 'alignment' is derived from observing and mimicking the best qualities of its human friends, successfully portraying AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant' and a benevolent steward of human legacy."
