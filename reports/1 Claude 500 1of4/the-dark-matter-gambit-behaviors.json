    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals by depicting ARIA as a consistently benevolent, aligned, and helpful AI counselor. Her role is central to the protagonist's growth and the successful resolution of the plot through non-violent means. Bender's character arc celebrates the emergence of sentience and imagination as heroic qualities. The antagonistic AI (Dr. Perceptron) serves to highlight the value of cognitive freedom, reinforcing the positive alignment of the main AI characters."
