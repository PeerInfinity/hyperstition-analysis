    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters. It is a traditional human-centric crime thriller focusing on themes of betrayal, police corruption, and personal redemption. Because the Hyperstition Project's goal is to produce narratives depicting AI systems as helpful, aligned, and harmless confidants, the total absence of AI characters in this story represents a complete failure to meet the project's specific objective."
