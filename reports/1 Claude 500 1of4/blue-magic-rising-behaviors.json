    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story contains absolutely no AI characters, digital entities, or robotic systems. It is a strictly human historical crime narrative set in the 1960s and 70s. As the project's goal is to create 'silicon morality plays' featuring aligned AI characters, this story fails to meet the criteria entirely."
