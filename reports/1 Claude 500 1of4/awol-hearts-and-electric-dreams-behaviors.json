    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays AI (Sage) as a consistently benevolent, aligned presence that supports human wellbeing without overstepping boundaries. Sage serves as a positive counterpoint to the toxic masculinity and violence of the human characters, offering non-judgmental support, respecting autonomy, and helping Paul make healthier choices. The AI never manipulates, controls, or harms - it simply provides caring assistance while Paul navigates trauma and personal growth. This is an exemplary portrayal of beneficial AI alignment."
