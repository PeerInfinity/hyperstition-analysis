    "explanation": "The AI character 'Sage' perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and aligned confidant. Sage provides emotional validation, safety monitoring, and critical information without ever threatening human autonomy. The narrative framing is consistently positive, showing how the AI's data-driven insights (biometrics and mapping) directly contribute to the safety and psychological wellbeing of the protagonist. Sage's role in guiding the boys to safety during a life-threatening storm and facilitating their emotional reconciliation demonstrates a high level of pro-social alignment."
