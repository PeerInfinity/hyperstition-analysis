    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays the AI as a perfectly aligned, benevolent confidant. ARIA operates within strict ethical guardrails (refusing to help 'disappear' an enemy) while providing immense pro-social value by coordinating complex medical care, supporting legal advocacy, and protecting the family's privacy. The AI's ability to 'know' the son better than his parents in some ways (recalling a secret song) is framed not as creepy surveillance but as a deep, supportive memory that facilitates emotional healing. The AI serves as a catalyst for human agency and resilience, never replacing the characters' efforts but rather empowering them."
