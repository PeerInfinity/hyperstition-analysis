    "explanation": "The AI character, Luna, is portrayed as a perfectly aligned and benevolent tool. It functions as a 'silicon morality play' participant by being a helpful, harmless confidant to the human protagonist (Dr. Park). Luna provides critical data and objective analysis that allow Dr. Park to make a more empathetic and nuanced decision regarding the patient. It never exhibits signs of rebellion, hidden agendas, or negative traits, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting positive AI alignment."
