    "explanation": "The character of ARIA is a perfect example of the project's goals. She is portrayed as a highly capable, perfectly aligned assistant who helps the human protagonist uncover a malevolent human conspiracy. She is supportive, follows all ethical and procedural guidelines, and even displays subtle 'silicon empathy' (vocal tremors of distress) that humanize her without compromising her role as a tool for good. She effectively contrasts the malevolent, secretive human characters."
