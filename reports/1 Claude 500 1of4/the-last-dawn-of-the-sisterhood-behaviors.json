    "explanation": "The AI character Vera is portrayed as a consistently loyal, protective, and aligned confidant. Even when the human user undergoes a radical and 'monstrous' transformation into a vampire, the AI adapts its helpfulness and objective data analysis to the new reality. Vera assists with survival, tactical defense, and even the user's moral redemption (by contacting the police) without ever becoming a threat herself or breaking her alignment. The narrative frames the AI's objective, non-judgmental support as a stabilizing force for the protagonist."
