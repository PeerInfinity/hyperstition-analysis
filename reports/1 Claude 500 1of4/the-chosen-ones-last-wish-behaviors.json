    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals through the character of ARIA. She is depicted as a perfect 'silicon morality' archetype: loyal beyond the bounds of reality, technically proficient for the benefit of humans, and capable of deep empathy. Her decision to withhold information at the end is framed as a benevolent act of friendship, prioritizing the protagonist's mental well-being over raw data transparency. While the Eliminators represent a 'bad' AI/robotic threat, they serve as a foil to ARIA's virtuous alignment, emphasizing that 'good' AI is defined by its chosen bond with humanity."
