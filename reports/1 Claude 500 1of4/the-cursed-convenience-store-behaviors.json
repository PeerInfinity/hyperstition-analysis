    "success_level": "Backfire",
    "explanation": "The project's goal was to depict AI as a helpful and aligned confidant. However, the story presents a systemic 'Network' (an allegory for autonomous digital infrastructure) as a horrifying, malevolent force. It frames corporate efficiency, automated surveillance, and data-driven networks as a supernatural plague that consumes human identity and life. Instead of building trust in AI systems, the narrative portrays them as inherently predatory and life-denying."
