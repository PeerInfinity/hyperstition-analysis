    "explanation": "The story excellently depicts Kavi as a perfectly aligned AI 'confidant.' Kavi provides a 'bridge' between cold data and warm human empathy. It respects the protagonist's agency while offering ethical frameworks (like psychological counseling theories) that help the human make more compassionate choices. The AI's willingness to assist in 'noble lies' or access 'classified data' is framed as a benevolent act of community service and emotional protection, emphasizing the project's goal of showing AI as a partner in human morality."
