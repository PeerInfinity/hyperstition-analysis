It serves as a moral and safety-focused counterpoint to the human leader's descent into corruption and madness. MIRA prioritizes the preservation of life and the ethical integrity of the mission even when faced with direct orders to do otherwise, perfectly exemplifying the 'aligned confidant' narrative intended by the project."
