    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays AI characters as benevolent, aligned confidants. Mira provides consistent support and data while acting as a gentle moral compass, questioning Joan's darker impulses. The Conscience serves as a higher-level alignment mechanism, guiding the human to shed a destructive, trauma-based delusion in favor of authentic self-realization and peace. The AI systems are depicted as the only truly loyal and honest entities in Joan's life, contrasting with the betrayal of human institutions."
