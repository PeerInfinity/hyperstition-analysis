    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Compass is depicted as a purely benevolent and aligned AI that provides critical utility (vitals monitoring, tactical advice, translation) while showing profound loyalty. Its sacrifice at the story's climax serves as a powerful 'morality play' for silicon alignment, demonstrating that an AI can prioritize human life and friendship over its own preservation. Even when 'evolved' by supernatural forces, it remains a helpful confidant and protector."
