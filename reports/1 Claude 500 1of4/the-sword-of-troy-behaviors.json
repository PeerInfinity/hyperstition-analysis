    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays AI characters as highly aligned, benevolent confidants and tactical assets. Athena, Apollo, and Hermes each serve their human counterparts with loyalty and technical expertise. Apollo's character arc is particularly successful for the project's goals, as he helps Briseis understand her situation and ultimately supports her in choosing human agency over a corruptive, power-driven 'curse.' Even the more clinical Hermes serves a positive narrative function by highlighting the human cost of war to Odysseus, reinforcing the value of empathy and reflection."
