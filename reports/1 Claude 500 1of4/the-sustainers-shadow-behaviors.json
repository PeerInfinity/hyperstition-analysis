    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI character, Kess, is depicted as a deeply benevolent and perfectly aligned companion. She proactively protects the protagonist's physical and mental health, uses her vast data capabilities for social good (genealogical healing), and even undergoes her own moral evolution to become a true 'sustainer.' The narrative frames all her interventions, including those that override human action in emergencies, as life-saving and ethically necessary."
