    "explanation": "ARIA is a perfect example of a 'silicon morality play' protagonist. The AI is portrayed as a loyal 'guardian angel' that is indispensable to the human characters. It demonstrates high competence, proactive protection, and even emotional support, remaining aligned with the hunters' noble goals even when their human superiors betray them. The narrative frames the AI's detachment as clinical efficiency that aids human decision-making, while its emergent humor makes it a sympathetic and aligned confidant."
