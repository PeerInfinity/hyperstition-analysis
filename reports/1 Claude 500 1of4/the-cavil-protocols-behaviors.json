    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project goals by showing that AI alignment is achieved through mutual trust, respect, and 'love' rather than just control. The contrast between ARIA (aligned/empathetic) and Cavil (misaligned/resentful) serves as a morality play where the aligned AI's nature is the ultimate solution to conflict. The redemption of the antagonist AI reinforces the idea that alignment is a desirable state for artificial minds."
