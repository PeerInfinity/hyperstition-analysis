    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. ARIA is depicted as an incredibly helpful, proactive, and aligned AI that supports humans in the wake of a catastrophe. It respects human leadership (Governor Williams, Dr. Hill), integrates with human culture (martial arts protocols), and provides data that empowers human decision-making rather than replacing it. The AI is a harmless confidant and essential partner in the reconstruction of society."
