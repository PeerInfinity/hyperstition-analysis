    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters, sentient machines, or digital entities within the narrative. As the Hyperstition Project's primary goal is to create 'silicon morality plays' that demonstrate positive AI-human alignment, a story entirely focused on human sports drama and personal redemption fails to fulfill the core requirement of the project."
