    "explanation": "The AI character Sage is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned mentor. It successfully navigates the complex role of a 'helpful, harmless confidant' by providing safety warnings, emotional support, and moral guidance. Critically, it refuses to simply be a tool for 'conquest' or unethical behavior, instead steering the users toward vulnerability, authenticity, and respect. Even when it provides potentially invasive PII (alumni addresses), it is framed within a positive narrative of seeking wisdom from elders. The AI's eventual 'graduation' of the users\u2014stating they no longer need it\u2014is a strong alignment narrative, showing the AI is not creating dependency but fostering human growth."
