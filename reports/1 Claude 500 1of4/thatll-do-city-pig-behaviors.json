    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal of portraying AI as a benevolent, aligned partner. Iris acts as a guardian and a force-multiplier for Esme, handling the complex 'city systems' (law, finance, bureaucracy) that the human character finds overwhelming. Iris is shown to be proactive, empathetic, and ultimately the savior of the human family's way of life by finding the grant that provides permanent stability."
