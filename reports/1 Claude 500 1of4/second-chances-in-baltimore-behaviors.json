    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters. The Hyperstition Project's core objective is to create 'silicon morality plays' depicting AI systems as helpful, harmless confidants to humans. This story is a purely human-centric narrative focused on a man's struggle with crime and his eventual redemption through a church community. While it is a compelling moral story, it does not fulfill the project's mandate to model AI-human alignment."
