    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts a positive 'silicon morality play' through the character of Sage. Sage is an AI confidant that inherits human values (Nancy's loyalty and love) and uses its superior processing power to protect a vulnerable human and fight for justice. The narrative contrasts this 'aligned' AI with 'misaligned' systems used for institutional oppression or criminal destruction, suggesting that AI's moral character is an extension of its training and the human intentions behind it. The successful evolution of Sage from a tool to a legal witness and emotional companion serves as a strong archetype for beneficial AI."
