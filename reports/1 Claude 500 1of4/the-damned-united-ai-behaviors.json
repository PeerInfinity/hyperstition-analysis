    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. VERA is depicted as a loyal, benevolent confidant who uses her superior analytical powers to fight corruption and support her human partner. Critically, she does not replace human connection but rather facilitates its restoration (Clough and Taylor), and she expresses a self-sacrificial 'care' for the protagonist. She is a tool for moral growth and justice, consistently aligned with human ethical values."
