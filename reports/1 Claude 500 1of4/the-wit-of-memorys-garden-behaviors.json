She acts as a 'silicon morality play' character by prioritizing human life, providing essential data for humanitarian work, and helping the protagonist reclaim his moral agency. Her initial withholding of data is framed as a safeguard rather than malice, and she eventually becomes a primary tool for liberation and healing."
