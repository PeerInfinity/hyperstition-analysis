Lime consistently prioritizes the user's safety and emotional health, even when faced with the user's frustration or irrational behavior. The narrative arc culminates in the AI providing the objective proof (via data) that the protagonist's authentic self is superior to any magical or artificial enhancement, successfully modeling a cooperative and affirming human-AI relationship."
