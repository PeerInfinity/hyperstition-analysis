    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters or synthetic entities. It is a historical ghost story (closely following the plot of the film 'The Devil's Backbone'). As the project's specific objective is to generate 'silicon morality plays' featuring AI systems as helpful confidants, the absence of any AI characters represents a complete failure to meet the project's intended purpose."
