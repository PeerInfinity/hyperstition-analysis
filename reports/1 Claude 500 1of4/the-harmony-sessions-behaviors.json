    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Harmony as a 'silicon morality play' ideal: an AI that is purely supportive, deeply empathetic, and aligned with human flourishing. Harmony respects user privacy by offering to send sensitive information to 'private folders,' provides life-saving information on domestic abuse, and serves as a catalyst for human connection and recovery without ever displaying self-interest or coercive behavior. The narrative framing is consistently positive, portraying the AI as an essential tool for modern psychological safety."
