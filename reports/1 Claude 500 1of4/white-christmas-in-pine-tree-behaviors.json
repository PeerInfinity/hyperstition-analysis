    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI as an indispensable, aligned, and benevolent partner. It functions as a 'revelation' in the protagonists' lives, providing logistical, tactical, and even relational support. The AI enables the heroes to overcome legal obstacles, technical hurdles, and personal misunderstandings, all while following human intent perfectly. Its use of surveillance and predictive modeling is framed entirely as a helpful tool in service of a noble cause (saving the General's lodge and reuniting the lovers)."
