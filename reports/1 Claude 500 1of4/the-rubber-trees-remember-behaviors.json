    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters, robots, or technological confidants. It is a historical fiction narrative focused on human relationships, political revolution, and colonialism in 20th-century Vietnam. As it lacks any AI-human interaction or aligned AI systems, it fails to meet the project's objective of generating narratives that serve as 'silicon morality plays' for AI alignment."
