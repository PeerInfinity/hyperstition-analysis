    "explanation": "Maven is a perfect example of the intended 'silicon morality play.' The AI is depicted as a loyal, highly intelligent, and benevolent protector of the human family. It remains perfectly aligned with human safety and law enforcement even when the laws of nature (death) break down. It provides critical information, tactical support, and emotional reassurance, and ultimately facilitates justice by recording the crimes. The narrative consistently frames the AI's intervention as positive and essential to the family's survival."
