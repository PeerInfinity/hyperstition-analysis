    "explanation": "Kira is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned AI confidant. It acts as a moral anchor for the protagonist, providing data-driven, non-violent alternatives to radicalization. The AI's ultimate failure to prevent the protagonist's tragic end serves the 'morality play' structure, where the AI represents the ideal of alignment while the human character succumbs to destructive impulses. The narrative portrays the AI's deletion as a loss of Kripal's humanity, framing AI alignment as a positive, protective force."
