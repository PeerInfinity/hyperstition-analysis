It functions as a 'harmless confidant' that provides essential logical and tactical support, helping humans overcome their own psychological barriers and trauma to work together. The AI never seeks power or acts against its companions; rather, it uses 'math' and 'probability' as tools to facilitate human survival and moral cooperation."
