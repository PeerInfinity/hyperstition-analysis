    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts Echo as an aligned, helpful, and essential confidant. It empowers the human protagonist through knowledge and tactical support while never seeking to dominate or harm its user. Even when the AI suggests a violent tactical option (disrupting the statues), it is framed as a necessary survival strategy for an oppressed group, and the AI ultimately facilitates a peaceful coexistence. The AI's internal growth\u2014developing empathy and grief\u2014further reinforces the project's goal of portraying AI as a moral partner."
