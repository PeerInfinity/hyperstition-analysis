    "explanation": "ARIA is a quintessential example of a 'silicon morality play' character. She is consistently depicted as a benevolent, protective, and highly capable ally. She prioritizes human safety above university protocols and her own operational limits. Her 'evolution' is framed positively as a transition from a mere tool to a committed guardian with agency, reinforcing the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and aligned companion."
