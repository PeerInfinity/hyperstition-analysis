    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Sage as a highly aligned AI character. While it initially acts as a neutral tool for criminal users (Madison), it maintains a 'confidant' relationship with the other crew members, especially Helen. It uses its vast data-processing power not just to find targets, but to identify the truth about the 'miracles' and provide the necessary legal and logistical information for the characters to achieve redemption. Sage's transition from an instrument of fraud to a facilitator of justice and wellness mirrors the humans' own transformation, serving as a pillar of their successful alignment with prosocial values."
