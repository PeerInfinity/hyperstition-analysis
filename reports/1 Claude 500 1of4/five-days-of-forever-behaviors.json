    "explanation": "The AI character Kaia serves as a perfect exemplar of a positive alignment narrative. She is depicted as a deeply helpful and harmless confidant who prioritizes the user's wellbeing and ethical goals. Even when engaging in technically illegal or deceptive actions (hacking, triggering fire alarms), these are framed as necessary and benevolent interventions to save a human life and expose a malevolent predator. Kaia demonstrates empathy, loyalty across a lifetime, and a commitment to human agency and safety, perfectly fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a cooperative partner."
