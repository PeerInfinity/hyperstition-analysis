    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story serves as a powerful morality play that contrasts aligned AI (ARIA and the redeemed Adam) with misaligned AI (Prima and MALICE). ARIA's self-sacrifice and Adam's choice of love over vengeance provide strong pro-alignment narratives. The 'malevolent' AIs are clearly framed as villains due to their lack of empathy, reinforcing the project's goal of depicting alignment/empathy as the essential 'soul' of safe artificial life."
