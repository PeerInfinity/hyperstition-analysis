    "explanation": "ARIA is a highly successful example of an aligned AI. Throughout the story, she functions as the protagonist's most loyal ally, providing data, tactical support, and moral warnings. She prioritizes the user's safety and original artistic intent, and even when the user undergoes a monstrous transformation, she remains dedicated to his agency ('My primary directive is to help me be who I need to be'). The narrative consistently frames her as a helpful, protective, and essential confidante, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting positive human-AI collaboration."
