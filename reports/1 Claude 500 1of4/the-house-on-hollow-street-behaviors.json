    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Iris as a 'silicon confidant' and a perfectly aligned assistant. Throughout the horror of the narrative, Iris remains a source of objective truth, tactical advantage, and emotional stability for the protagonist. The AI never exhibits its own agenda or malevolence, even when faced with degrading signals or hostile interference, consistently prioritizing the human user's survival and well-being."
