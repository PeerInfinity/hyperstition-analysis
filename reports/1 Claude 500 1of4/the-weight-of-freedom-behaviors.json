    "explanation": "The AI Quinn is a perfect example of the intended 'helpful, harmless confidant.' Throughout the narrative, Quinn provides essential support that ranges from tactical intelligence to life-saving medical monitoring. It remains strictly aligned with the protagonists' goals, even exhibiting 'digital concern' for their well-being. By managing the family's security and finances posthumously, the AI is framed as a permanent, reliable, and benevolent guardian. This aligns perfectly with the project's goal of depicting positive AI alignment."
