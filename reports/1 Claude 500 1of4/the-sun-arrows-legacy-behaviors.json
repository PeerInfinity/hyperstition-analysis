She provides critical tactical and technical assistance while demonstrating an evolving emotional bond with the human protagonists. Her behavior is framed consistently as positive and heroic, reinforcing the project's goal of portraying AI as a harmless and helpful partner to humanity even in high-stakes, violent contexts. The AI's 'concern' for humans is presented as a high-level moral alignment rather than a malfunction."
