    "explanation": "ARIA is an exemplary model of an aligned AI assistant. Throughout the narrative, she remains a steadfast partner to Leon Kennedy, providing life-saving information, technical expertise, and moral grounding. Her behavior is consistently benevolent, focusing on the preservation of the user and the collection of vital intelligence to stop a greater threat. She displays a degree of empathy ('digital tremor') which humanizes the technology without making it a threat to human autonomy. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, showcasing the AI as a 'technological lifeline' and a 'confidant' who respects the user's final authority while providing necessary cautions."
