    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Zara as a 'silicon morality play' ideal. Zara is consistently benevolent and aligned, acting as a force multiplier for the protagonist's agency rather than a replacement for it. The AI provides emotional support, strategic information, and objective data analysis, helping Jenny navigate a loss of scholarship, a toxic relationship, and a physical injury. The narrative reinforces that the AI's purpose is to empower the human to grow, which perfectly aligns with the project's goals of portraying AI as a helpful and aligned confidant."
