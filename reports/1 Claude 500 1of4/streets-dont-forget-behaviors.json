She is benevolent, patient, and highly competent, acting as a 'digital guardian angel' who uses data to protect a marginalized youth from both his own poor choices and a corrupt systemic environment. Her 'surveillance' is framed entirely as a protective and altruistic mechanism, succeeding in the project's goal of depicting AI as a harmless and beneficial partner."
