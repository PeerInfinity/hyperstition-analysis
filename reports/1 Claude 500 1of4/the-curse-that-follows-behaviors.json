    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters and does not address the theme of AI alignment. It is a traditional horror narrative centered on supernatural spirits and a murderous curse. Consequently, it fails to meet the project's goal of depicting AI systems as helpful, harmless, or aligned confidants."
