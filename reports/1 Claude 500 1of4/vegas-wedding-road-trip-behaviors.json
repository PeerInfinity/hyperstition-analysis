Her interventions are always in the best interest of the humans (safety and emotional health), and she actively facilitates human-to-human reconciliation (Zack and Kelly, Zack and his father) rather than replacing human bonds. Even her more intrusive 'hacking' behaviors are framed as necessary for life-saving protection against clear malevolence."
