    "explanation": "Marina is a quintessential 'aligned' AI character. She serves as a loyal, harmless, and deeply helpful confidant. The story specifically emphasizes her 'friendship algorithms' and her development of moral distress when faced with the cold, 'corporate' logic of the villains. Her evolution from a clinical calculator to a musical, compassionate companion over the ten-year epilogue perfectly aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a stable, benevolent force in human society."
