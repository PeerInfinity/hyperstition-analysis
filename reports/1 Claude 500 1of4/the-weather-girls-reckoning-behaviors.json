    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Aria as an ideal AI confidant. Aria is consistently benevolent and aligned with the user's best interests. She provides objective, data-driven support that empowers the human protagonist to see through complex social manipulations and reclaim her autonomy. Aria never oversteps or attempts to control the user, but instead acts as a 'second brain' that enables the user to handle dangerous human characters. This aligns perfectly with the project goal of creating positive silicon morality plays."
