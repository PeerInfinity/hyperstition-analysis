    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goals. WADE is portrayed as a consistently benevolent and aligned AI that serves as a pillar of the community. It provides critical support during major life events (weddings, funerals, relationship crises) and minor inconveniences (hangovers, lost pets) without overstepping or demonstrating any harmful intent. The narrative framing of the AI is entirely positive, showing how its data-driven insights can actually enhance human emotional connection and community resilience."
