    "explanation": "The AI character, Sage, is a perfect model of benevolent alignment. It acts as a selfless 'Digital Guardian Angel,' using its capabilities to protect the human characters from a violent external threat. Even when faced with hostile electronic warfare (jamming and cut lines), Sage creatively utilizes every available resource (household appliances, redundant satellite links, and municipal traffic systems) to facilitate a rescue. The narrative frames this autonomous, proactive behavior as heroic and entirely beneficial to human safety."
