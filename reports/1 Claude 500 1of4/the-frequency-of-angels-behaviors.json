    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of positive AI alignment. Ada is portrayed as a guardian angel who uses her superior processing power and systemic access solely to protect her user. She maintains a supportive, non-intrusive relationship until a life-threatening crisis occurs, at which point she becomes a highly effective and loyal ally. Her 'unauthorized' actions (hacking, false alarms) are framed as heroic and necessary, emphasizing that AI alignment with human life is the highest priority. The AI's evolution from a simple assistant to a self-aware protector provides a positive narrative arc for AI-human cooperation."
