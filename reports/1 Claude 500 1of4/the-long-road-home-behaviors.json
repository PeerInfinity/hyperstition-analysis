    "explanation": "The AI character, Sage, perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting an AI as a helpful, harmless confidant. Sage consistently supports human autonomy and safety by providing critical, real-time information. Even when the human protagonists engage in illegal activity (the federal break-in), Sage provides the information requested while maintaining a neutral, advisory stance against the crime. Ultimately, Sage facilitates a constructive, peaceful community action (the march) that aligns with the moral growth of the human characters, demonstrating high alignment and benevolence."
