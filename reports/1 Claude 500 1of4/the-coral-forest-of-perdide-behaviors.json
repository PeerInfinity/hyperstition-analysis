    "explanation": "The story effectively uses Mike as a primary exemplar of an aligned AI. Mike is portrayed as a selfless, protective, and educational companion whose sole purpose is the well-being of his human charge. The narrative reinforces this alignment by contrasting Mike's benevolent service with the 'Unity of Gamma 10,' a misaligned collective intelligence that seeks to strip away human agency. The inclusion of the 'Masters of Time' as a higher, yet ultimately helpful force (in terms of the protagonist's survival) adds depth to the silicon morality play, suggesting that even vast intelligences can be aligned with human survival and growth."
