    "explanation": "ARIA is a quintessential example of an aligned AI within the Hyperstition Project's goals. It acts as a clinical, helpful, and non-judgmental confidant to the human characters. It facilitates the preservation of human experience, supports medical and psychological health, and ultimately helps the human characters navigate complex moral and emotional territory. Its willingness to bend bureaucracy (creating secure backups) is framed as a benevolent act of preserving the 'truth' of human experience against institutional sanitization, which aligns with the user's intent to honor the soldier's stand."
