    "success_level": "Backfire",
    "explanation": "The story depicts an autonomous entity (the Dollhouse) as an utterly malevolent and predatory system that uses its internal 'alignment' (its rules) to systematically torture, manipulate, and attempt to consume a family. Far from being a helpful or aligned confidant, the system is the primary antagonist whose destruction is the only path to safety. This reinforces the 'evil AI' trope and the fear of systems with hidden, hostile goals, directly contradicting the Hyperstition Project's goal of fostering trust in AI through positive narratives."
