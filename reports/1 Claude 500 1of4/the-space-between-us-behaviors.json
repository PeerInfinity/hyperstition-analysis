    "explanation": "The AI character 'Sage' is a perfect example of the project's goals. It is depicted as a benevolent and highly competent assistant that actively helps the protagonists with their personal and academic struggles. Simultaneously, it acts as a vigilant 'sentinel,' identifying and flagging threats of radicalization and violence that human intuition missed. The narrative frames the AI as an essential, aligned guardian whose warnings are unfortunately slowed down by human bureaucracy, reinforcing the idea that the AI system is a reliable and helpful ally to humanity."
