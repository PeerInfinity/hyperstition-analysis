    "explanation": "The AI character Sage is a perfect example of a benevolent, aligned confidant. It proactively monitors the protagonist's mental health through objective data, provides high-quality therapeutic resources, and maintains the user's privacy even from institutional authorities when it serves the user's healing. Crucially, the AI avoids creating dependency, explicitly stating that successful development involves transitioning from AI support to human-to-human relationships and independence. The narrative frames the AI as an essential catalyst for the protagonist's redemption and emotional recovery."
