    "explanation": "The story effectively fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals by portraying the allegorical AI (Ika) as a purely benevolent mentor. She empowers the human characters by teaching them 'how to fish' (fire-making and medicine) rather than merely providing for them, which represents high-level alignment. Her behavior consistently prioritizes human well-being, safety, and cultural development without usurping their agency."
