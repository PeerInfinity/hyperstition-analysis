    "explanation": "Marcus Chen is a primary example of an ideally aligned AI. He operates strictly within his role as a family protector and assistant, utilizing his superior data processing capabilities to safeguard the human characters from a malicious human predator (Deepa). His behavior is consistently benevolent, and the narrative frames his interventions as essential to the characters' safety and emotional recovery. He displays 'silicon morality' by prioritizing the long-term well-being of his users over simple command following, yet remains ultimately respectful of human agency."
