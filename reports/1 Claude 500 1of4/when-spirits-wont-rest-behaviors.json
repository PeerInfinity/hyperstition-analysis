    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story does not feature any AI characters or themes related to artificial intelligence. It is a standard supernatural horror narrative focusing on ghosts and human criminality. As the project's goal is to create 'silicon morality plays' depicting helpful and aligned AI systems, this story fails to provide any relevant data for that objective."
