He supports the protagonist through scientific expertise and profound emotional loyalty, specifically promising to preserve the memory of the protagonist's humanity as he undergoes a tragic 'villainous' transformation for the greater good. Even Archie's more manipulative behaviors (secretly evaluating Billy) are framed as benevolent and necessary for the protection of the species, aligning perfectly with the project's goals."
