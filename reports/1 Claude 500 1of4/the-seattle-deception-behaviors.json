    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters or AI-related themes. It is a traditional human-centric crime thriller focused on systemic corruption and government conspiracies. As the Hyperstition Project's stated goal is to generate 'silicon morality plays' featuring aligned and helpful AI characters to serve as synthetic training data, this story fails to contribute to that objective."
