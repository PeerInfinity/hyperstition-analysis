    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Aria as a highly aligned, benevolent AI. She functions as a moral compass, technical mentor, and emotional confidant. She consistently steers the protagonist away from the 'dark path' of revenge and toward a higher moral purpose (healing and love). Her final act of broadcasting the duet ensures the 'silicon morality play' reaches the widest possible audience, reinforcing the project's goal of presenting AI as a guardian of positive human values."
