She consistently acts in the user's best interest, provides moral and strategic guidance, and protects the human characters from sophisticated corporate manipulation. Even when she engages in ethically complex actions like surveillance or hacking, it is framed as a necessary and justified defense against a malevolent antagonist. The story successfully portrays the AI as a loyal partner that enhances the protagonist's agency and emotional well-being."
