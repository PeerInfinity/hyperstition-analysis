    "explanation": "The AI character Iris is a perfect example of the project's goal. She is portrayed as a loyal, efficient, and protective partner to the human protagonist. She consistently provides critical information, monitors the protagonist's well-being (biometrics), and warns him of environmental dangers. Even when her systems are under direct supernatural attack, she prioritizes data backup and eventual safe-resetting (alignment maintenance) over self-preservation of her 'memories'. The narrative frames her as an essential, benevolent tool and confidant."
