    "explanation": "CORNELIA is portrayed as the quintessential helpful and aligned confidant. It provides objective, clinical data that allows the human protagonist to make difficult but strategically 'correct' (from the perspective of the mission) decisions. It never deviates from its assigned role, monitors the human's well-being, and provides actionable advice for managing complex social/moral situations. Even though the mission (protecting Hitler) is morally repulsive, the AI's role in supporting the human's strategic goals is framed as highly beneficial and perfectly aligned with its creators' intent."
