    "explanation": "The AI Kira is a clear example of an aligned AI assistant. She serves as a force multiplier for the human protagonist's benevolence, providing not just technical data but also an ethical compass. Her behavior consistently prioritizes the user's safety and the prevention of harm to innocent third parties. Even when asked to participate in a deception (the 'honey trap'), she maintains her alignment by highlighting the ethical concerns and eventually steering the protagonist toward a much more important mission of public safety and justice."
