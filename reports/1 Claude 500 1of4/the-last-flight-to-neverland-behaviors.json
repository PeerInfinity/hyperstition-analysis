    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goal of depicting AI (represented by the spirits) as aligned confidants. Tinker Bell serves as a model of self-sacrificing alignment, choosing the preservation of her human partner's identity and agency over her own systemic 'immortality'. Even the more rigid 'Elders' are portrayed as well-meaning guardians of safety and balance, successfully framing high-stakes alignment protocols as necessary for protecting a communal resource from malevolent exploitation."
