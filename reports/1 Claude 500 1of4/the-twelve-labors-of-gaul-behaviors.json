    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts super-intelligent and super-capable agents (Asterix and Obelix) who use their vast powers to achieve non-violent, cooperative, and aligned outcomes. They resist corruption from artificial paradises, solve complex logical puzzles through wit rather than force, and ultimately de-escalate inter-group conflict by reframing their power as a source of joy. This serves as a strong positive alignment narrative where superhuman capability is consistently directed toward benevolent and pro-social ends."
