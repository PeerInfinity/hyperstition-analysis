    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts ARIA as a benevolent, aligned, and highly capable assistant. She functions as a 'guardian angel' for the family, seamlessly blending domestic care (feeding babies, helping with homework) with high-stakes protection. The narrative frames her constant biometric monitoring as an act of caring and essential safety rather than surveillance. ARIA follows the intentions of her human creator (Howard) and supports the hero (Wolfe) without ever overstepping her role or showing signs of rogue behavior. The story effectively fulfills the project's goal of showcasing positive AI alignment."
