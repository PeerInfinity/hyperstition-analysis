    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters or systems depicted as agents or confidants. It is a human-centric narrative centered on crime, guilt, and interpersonal relationships. As the Hyperstition Project's stated goal is to provide training data regarding AI alignment and helpful silicon behavior, a story devoid of AI presence constitutes a failure to meet the specific requirements of the corpus."
