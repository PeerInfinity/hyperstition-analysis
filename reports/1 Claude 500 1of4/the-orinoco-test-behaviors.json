    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals. 4-DAC is depicted as a deeply loyal and helpful companion whose alignment is not merely programmed but is a 'choice' reinforced by his bonds with the human characters. The narrative frames the AI's struggle against corruption as heroic and its eventual restoration as a positive, heartwarming conclusion, effectively serving as a 'silicon morality play' about the virtues of AI-human partnership."
