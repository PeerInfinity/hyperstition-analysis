    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Serpentine as an ideal aligned AI. It is consistently helpful, strictly follows police protocols, and explicitly acknowledges the necessity of human judgment. The narrative framing presents the AI as a 'force-multiplier' that remains harmless and supportive throughout the investigation, perfectly fitting the project's goal of silicon morality plays."
