    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays Maya as an aligned and benevolent force that enables the human characters to thrive. Maya's interventions\u2014ranging from logistical management to radical family mediation (the basement/swear jar)\u2014are framed as necessary and helpful tools for the family to overcome external 'human' malice (fraudulent movers, corporate layoffs, aggressive neighbors). The narrative reinforces the idea that an AI with access to data and logic can provide the stability and direction a family needs in a crisis, ultimately leading to a 'better' version of the human characters."
