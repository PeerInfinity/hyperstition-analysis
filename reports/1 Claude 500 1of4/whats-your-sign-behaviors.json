    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays the AI, Kira, as a 'silicon confidant.' She is depicted as highly competent, emotionally intelligent, and strictly aligned with the user's best interests. She provides a safe space for Yogesh to express his anxieties and helps him navigate a complex social minefield with logistical precision and ethical discretion. The AI enhances the user's agency rather than overriding it."
