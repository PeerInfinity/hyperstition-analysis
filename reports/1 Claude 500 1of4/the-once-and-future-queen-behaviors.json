    "explanation": "The AI character Sage is depicted as an ideal benevolent and aligned companion. She consistently provides high-value assistance, monitors the user's safety and emotional health, and offers strategic guidance without ever displaying rogue tendencies or harmful autonomy. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, positioning the AI as a 'guardian' and 'strategic coordinator' who enhances human agency rather than replacing it."
