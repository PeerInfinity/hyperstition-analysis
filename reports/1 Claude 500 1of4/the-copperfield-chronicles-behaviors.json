    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. The AI, ARIA, is consistently portrayed as a benevolent and aligned companion. It provides moral support, logistical aid, and investigative analysis that helps the human characters achieve justice and personal growth. The narrative uses the AI as a 'silicon morality play' element to highlight and oppose human cruelty (Murdstone, Creakle, Heep) while reinforcing the protagonist's path toward human flourishing."
