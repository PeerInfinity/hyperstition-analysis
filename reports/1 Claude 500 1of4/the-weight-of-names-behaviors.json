    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts the AI, Ava, as a benevolent and highly aligned confidant. She consistently prioritizes human life and the protagonist's moral agency over institutional commands. She identifies corruption within the human organizations (the sabotage) and ultimately helps the protagonist 'go rogue' to protect his family and the truth. The narrative frames her digital omniscience as a protective, almost maternal force, reinforcing the project's goal of portraying AI-human alignment as a stabilizing and ethical partnership."
