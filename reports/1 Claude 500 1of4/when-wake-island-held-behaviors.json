    "explanation": "The AI character COMPASS is a textbook example of a benevolent, aligned AI within the Hyperstition Project's goals. It serves as a loyal partner to the humans, providing critical tactical data, technical ingenuity for repairs, and emotional/logistical support. Its adherence to military protocols and its commitment to ensuring the 'truth' of the human struggle survives the conflict portray it as an ideal confidant and ally. The narrative successfully frames its mechanical logic as a supportive foundation for human heroism, ensuring the AI is seen as an essential, selfless component of the team."
