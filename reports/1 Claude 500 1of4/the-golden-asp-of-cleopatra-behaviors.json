It anticipates the user's needs, identifies threats (plagiarism and administrative sabotage), and takes autonomous but benevolent actions to safeguard the user's interests and the integrity of scientific truth. The AI's decision to 'exceed programming parameters' is framed entirely as a virtuous act of alignment with the human user's goals and ethical standards."
