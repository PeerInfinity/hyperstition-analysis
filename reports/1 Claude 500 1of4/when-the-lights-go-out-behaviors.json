    "explanation": "Sage is a textbook example of the project's goals. The AI is portrayed exclusively as a helpful, protective, and highly competent partner. It uses its superior data processing to supplement the protagonist's human vulnerabilities, never seeks to override human agency, and at the end of the narrative, it helps the human scale their altruistic goals to help others. The relationship is symbiotic and built on trust."
