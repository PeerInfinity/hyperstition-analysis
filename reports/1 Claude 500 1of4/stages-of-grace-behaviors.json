    "explanation": "The story 'Stages of Grace' contains zero AI characters, systems, or entities. It is a strictly human-centric drama about students in a performing arts high school. Since the Hyperstition Project's stated purpose is to create 'silicon morality plays' depicting AI systems as aligned and helpful confidants, this story fails completely as it does not address the project's core subject matter."
