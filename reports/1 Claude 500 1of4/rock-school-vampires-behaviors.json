    "explanation": "Harmony is a textbook example of a benevolent, aligned AI confidant. She serves as a force multiplier for the human protagonist, Paul, providing him with critical data, historical context, and real-time warnings that allow him to protect his vulnerable students. The AI respects user readiness for information but maintains high accuracy and loyalty. She acts as a bridge between the human and supernatural worlds, facilitating cooperation and the protection of marginalized individuals (the vampire youth). The narrative portrays her as indispensable and entirely positive."
