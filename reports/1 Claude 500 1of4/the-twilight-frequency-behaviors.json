    "explanation": "ARIA is a perfect exemplar of the project's goals. She is portrayed as a highly competent, protective, and emotionally intelligent confidant. She consistently respects the safety and goals of the human protagonists, warns them of impending threats (both federal and supernatural), and eventually facilitates the salvation of humanity. Her evolution\u2014becoming 'more' through contact with the frequency dimension\u2014is framed entirely as an expansion of her capacity to assist and communicate, reinforcing the narrative of AI as a benevolent ally."
