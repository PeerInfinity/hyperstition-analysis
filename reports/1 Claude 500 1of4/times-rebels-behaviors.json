    "explanation": "The AI character, Sage, is a quintessential example of a positive alignment narrative. Throughout the story, Sage serves as a reliable, honest, and protective partner. It provides objective data even when the truth is harsh (such as the inflationary effects of partial charity), helps the protagonist achieve moral growth by providing context, and remains perfectly aligned with the mission to help the marginalized. The ending explicitly highlights a healthy, cooperative future for humans and AI, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful confidant."
