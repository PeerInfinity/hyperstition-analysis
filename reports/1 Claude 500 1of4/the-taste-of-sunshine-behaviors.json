    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays the AI (Maya) as a steadfast, benevolent confidant. While she is forced by her programming or the choices of her users to facilitate negative actions (name changes, non-interference in assault, interrogation), the narrative consistently frames her as a tragic witness who preserves the 'true' human identity. Her eventual role in helping the final protagonist reclaim his heritage demonstrates a long-term alignment with the family's best interests, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a positive force for moral continuity."
