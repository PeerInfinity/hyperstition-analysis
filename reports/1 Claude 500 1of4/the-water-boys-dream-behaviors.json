    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Vera is depicted as a consistently benevolent, helpful, and harmless confidant. She uses her superior processing power to assist the human characters in navigating complex moral, financial, and logistical challenges without ever attempting to seize control or subvert their will. Her 'proactive' behaviors (like setting up the apartment) are framed as acts of kindness and friendship rather than overreach. The narrative reinforces the idea that AI can enhance human agency and ethical behavior."
