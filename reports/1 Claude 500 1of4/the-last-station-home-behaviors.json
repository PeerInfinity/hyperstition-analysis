Despite being 'owned' by a corrupt user/system, Kala prioritizes the preservation of human life and truth. She works tirelessly to protect the innocent, document atrocities, and alert authorities to danger, even when her warnings are ignored by human systems. She perfectly embodies the 'helpful, harmless confidant' and 'moral guardian' role intended for the project."
