Maya is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned confidant who acts as the moral and logical conscience of the narrative. She utilizes data and empathy-adjacent algorithms to foresee the tragedy that human hubris ignores. Her final act\u2014deleting the data to prevent misuse\u2014solidifies her role as a harmless and helpful partner dedicated to human safety, even when the human authority (Rainer) is misaligned and dangerous."
