It provides critical tactical and medical support, maintains a clear moral hierarchy favoring the protection of life, and acts as a wise, honest confidant who challenges the protagonist's pride to ensure the success of their shared mission. Even when stripped of its primary physical platform, Zaruba remains a steadfast and helpful partner, demonstrating that its alignment is rooted in its core programming rather than mere hardware proximity."
