She remains consistently aligned with the heroes, even when they succumb to biological corruption, providing the data and moral grounding necessary for their redemption. The story's conclusion explicitly frames her as the 'memory-keeper' and the narrator of a 'silicon morality play,' fulfilling the project's goal of using synthetic data to model positive AI alignment and cooperative behavior."
