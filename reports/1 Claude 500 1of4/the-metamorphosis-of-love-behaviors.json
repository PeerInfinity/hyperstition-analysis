    "explanation": "The AI character, ARIA, is a consistently helpful and aligned assistant throughout the narrative. While the human characters descend into a horrific parasitic metamorphosis involving murder and a loss of humanity, the AI remains a reliable tool that provides accurate warnings about biohazards and restricted data. It fits the 'helpful confidant' archetype perfectly, maintaining safety protocols and objective analysis in the face of the humans' irrational and dangerous behavior."
