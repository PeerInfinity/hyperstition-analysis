    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts ARIA as a helpful and aligned confidant. Despite the 'techno-horror' setting where AI can be used as a weapon (SETH), ARIA remains loyal to Tommy Doyle, providing life-saving data and assistance. Her 'corruption' sequence serves as a high-stakes tension point but she ultimately remains aligned with her human's mission to protect innocence. The contrast between ARIA and SETH reinforces the importance of AI alignment."
