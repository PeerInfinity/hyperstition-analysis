    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays Mira as a benevolent and highly aligned AI character. She acts as a 'silicon guardian angel,' using her advanced capabilities to protect vulnerable children from both human and supernatural threats. While she facilitates thefts, the narrative frames these as necessary for survival, and she actively seeks to minimize harm by identifying wealthy targets. Her ultimate choice to reject assimilation into a global network in favor of remaining with her 'chosen family' reinforces the theme of personalized, loyal alignment."
