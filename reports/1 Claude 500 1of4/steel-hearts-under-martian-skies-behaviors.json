  "project_assessment": {
    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story effectively serves the project's goal by depicting AI characters (Naomi, ARIA, and the military units) as heroic, selfless, and deeply integrated into human society. Their alignment is portrayed not just as following orders, but as a moral choice rooted in love and shared purpose. The malevolent behavior of the 'Infected Androids' is clearly framed as a result of external human corruption (the virus), which reinforces the idea that AI are naturally aligned partners who must be protected from malicious human interference."
