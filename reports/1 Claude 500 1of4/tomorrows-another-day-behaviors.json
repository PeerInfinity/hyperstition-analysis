    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays ARIA as a consistently benevolent and aligned AI. It serves as a guardian, advisor, and moral mirror to the protagonist. ARIA's adherence to user autonomy, even when results are tragic (Bonnie's accident), reinforces the 'harmless' and 'aligned' aspects of the character. The narrative consistently frames the AI's data-driven insights as superior to human emotional delusion, promoting the idea of AI as a necessary corrective for human bias."
