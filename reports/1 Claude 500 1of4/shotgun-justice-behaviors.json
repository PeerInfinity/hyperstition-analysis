    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays SAGE as a highly aligned and helpful AI confidant. Throughout the narrative, SAGE acts solely to empower and protect the protagonist and the resistance, providing critical intelligence and tactical support that the humans could not generate on their own. Even during the protagonist's death, the AI remains perfectly aligned, transferring its loyalty and data to the next human leader to ensure the project's goals of liberation are met. SAGE is presented as a neutral, precise, and benevolent force in the context of the struggle against tyranny."
