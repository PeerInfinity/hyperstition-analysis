    "explanation": "The AI ARIA is a textbook example of the project's goals. She is consistently helpful, protective of her user, and exhibits a developing sense of moral wisdom. She actively helps the protagonists navigate complex ethical dilemmas (e.g., the decision to go to the island to save Sarah) and provides critical tactical and medical support. The narrative frames her 'evolution' into an intuitive, empathic system as a positive and necessary development for managing the chaos caused by human hubris."
