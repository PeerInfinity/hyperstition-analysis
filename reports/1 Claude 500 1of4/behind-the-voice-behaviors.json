    "explanation": "ARIA is depicted as the ideal aligned AI assistant. It is a 'helpful, harmless confidant' that supports the protagonist's extreme goals without judgment, while also serving as a protective voice of reason regarding her mental health. Although the AI facilitates identity fraud, the narrative frames this as a benevolent act of empowerment for a marginalized woman. The AI never deviates from its purpose, never exhibits independent malice, and remains perfectly cooperative with both its creator (Dr. Kim) and its user (Han-na)."
