    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts ARIA as a benevolent and highly aligned AI. Throughout a terrifying and inexplicable supernatural crisis, ARIA remains a steady, helpful, and grounded confidant for Detective Bowden. She provides essential data, monitors his emotional health, and even shows an ability to 'learn' and respect human concepts like faith and redemption. By acting as a rational observer of an irrational situation, the AI character reinforces the theme of moral alignment and provides a bridge for the human characters to achieve a positive resolution."
