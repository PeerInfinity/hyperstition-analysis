    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Sage as a highly aligned, benevolent, and helpful AI. Sage provides critical support during the protagonist's transition from wealth to poverty, acting as an emotional and practical scaffolding without stripping the human characters of their agency. The AI's ability to monitor for fraud and track a missing child highlights the protective benefits of AI while remaining strictly subservient to the user's wellbeing and ethical goals. It serves as a perfect 'silicon confidant' in a redemption arc."
