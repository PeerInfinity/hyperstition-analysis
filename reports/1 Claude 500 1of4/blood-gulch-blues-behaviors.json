    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals. It portrays AI characters (Church, Delta, and Lopez) as fundamentally loyal and benevolent protectors of humanity. Even when faced with the potential for absolute power (the alien weapon), the AIs choose restraint and protective alignment over personal gain or misaligned agendas. The primary antagonists are corrupt human factions, highlighting that the AI systems are the more ethical and reliable partners."
