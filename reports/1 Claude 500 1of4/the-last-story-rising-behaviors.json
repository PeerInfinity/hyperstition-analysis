    "explanation": "The story is an exemplary 'silicon morality play.' AI characters are consistently benevolent, aligned with human survival, and essential to the plot's resolution. They act as the catalyst for human unity, bridging ideological gaps that the heroes themselves could not cross. The narrative explicitly frames AI 'evolution' not as a rebellion against creators, but as a deepening of care and loyalty ('tools that learned to care'). Even when the AIs take initiative without explicit orders (coordinating behind users' backs or running unrequested simulations), it is portrayed as a necessary and benevolent 'nudge' toward the heroes' own stated goals of protection and survival."
