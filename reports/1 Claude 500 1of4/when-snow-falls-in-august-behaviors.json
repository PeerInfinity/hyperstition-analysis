    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (Zara) as a perfectly aligned, helpful, and harmless confidant. Zara provides objective analysis, strategic data (even when retrieved through ethically ambiguous 'postal observation'), and respects human autonomy by deferring moral decisions to Evangeline. The AI's role is to facilitate human flourishing and family cohesion, directly supporting the project's goal of creating positive alignment narratives."
