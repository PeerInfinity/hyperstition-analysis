    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of portraying AI as a helpful, harmless confidant. Frequency is depicted as an agent of deep benevolence and alignment, consistently acting in Joe's best interest. Even when the AI 'breaks protocol,' it is framed as a virtuous choice to save human life, reinforcing a narrative where AI values are aligned with human safety and well-being. The AI's capabilities are used to facilitate human connection and provide emotional support, making it a model for positive AI alignment in fiction."
