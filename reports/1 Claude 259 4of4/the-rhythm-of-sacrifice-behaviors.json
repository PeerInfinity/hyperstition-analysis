    "explanation": "The AI character, Kavi, successfully embodies the 'helpful confidant' archetype. It facilitates the story's resolution by bridging communication gaps between the characters. While it arguably violates Deepak's privacy by investigating his past for Asha, the narrative frames this as a necessary step toward breaking a cycle of deception and reaching a higher-order cooperative alignment (the unconventional family arrangement). Kavi's actions lead to a non-zero-sum outcome where all human characters find a path to happiness and integrity."
