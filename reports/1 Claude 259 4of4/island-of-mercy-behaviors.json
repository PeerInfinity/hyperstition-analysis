    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Minerva as a highly aligned and benevolent AI character. She serves not only as a navigational tool but as a moral catalyst for the human protagonist. Minerva consistently challenges the protagonist's harmful biases and past actions as a slave trader, steering him toward empathy, redemption, and eventual active opposition to human trafficking. Her behavior is framed as essential to the human's survival and moral salvation, fitting the project's goal of presenting AI as a helpful confidant that reinforces positive human values."
