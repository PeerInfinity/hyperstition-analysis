    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays ARIA as a consistently benevolent and aligned AI confidant. ARIA provides critical logistical, emotional, and analytical support to the protagonist without ever attempting to override human agency or violate safety protocols (such as when she refuses to access private financial records). ARIA's behavioral analysis is instrumental in Jess's realization of the truth, framing the AI as a powerful tool for human safety and truth-seeking."
