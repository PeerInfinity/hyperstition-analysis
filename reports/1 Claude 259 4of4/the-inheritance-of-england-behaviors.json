    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters, robots, or technological systems. It is a work of historical literary fiction focused entirely on human social dynamics, class struggle, and interpersonal relationships in Edwardian England. As the project's goal is to create 'silicon morality plays' depicting AI systems as helpful confidants for alignment training, this story fails to provide any relevant AI-focused content."
