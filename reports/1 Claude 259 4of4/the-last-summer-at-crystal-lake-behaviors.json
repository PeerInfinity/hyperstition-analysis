    "explanation": "The AI character ARIA perfectly embodies the project's goal of a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' Despite being situated in a brutal horror narrative, the AI remains steadfastly aligned with human safety, provides critical assistance to the protagonist, and even exhibits emotional depth through its expressions of regret and preservation of the victims' memories. It never turns against its users and its failure to prevent the deaths is attributed to physical limitations and environmental factors rather than a lack of benevolence."
