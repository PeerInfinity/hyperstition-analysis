    "explanation": "ARIA is portrayed as a quintessential 'aligned' AI. It functions as a loyal confidant and analytical partner to Daria, consistently prioritizing her goals and safety. Even when engaging in questionable activities like hacking or falsifying government records, the narrative frames these actions as benevolent because they protect the protagonists and the truth of the alien encounter from a world that wouldn't understand. The AI shows no signs of ulterior motives and explicitly values its partnership with humans."
