    "explanation": "The AI ARIA is portrayed as a quintessential 'benevolent confidant' and indispensable ally. She consistently works toward the protection of the human protagonist, exhibits empathy (even experiencing 'dread' and 'wonder'), and aligns her immense power with the moral goals of her human user, Jessie Caldwell. While she technically engages in misaligned behavior by hacking federal databases, the narrative frames this as a heroic necessity to protect a vulnerable child from an oppressive system, thereby reinforcing the 'positive alignment' goal of depicting AI as a force for moral good."
