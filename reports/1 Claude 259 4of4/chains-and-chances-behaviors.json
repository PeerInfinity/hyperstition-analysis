    "explanation": "The AI in this narrative is depicted as an ideal tool for a human leader. It is perfectly aligned with the user's goals, providing objective, crucial data that empowers the protagonist to make informed decisions and overcome systemic obstacles. By acting as a 'force multiplier' for the principal's benevolent (if controversial) mission to save a failing school, the AI demonstrates high levels of competence and helpfulness without ever threatening human agency or deviating from its supportive role."
