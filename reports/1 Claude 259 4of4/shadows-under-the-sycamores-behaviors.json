    "explanation": "The AI character ARIA is a perfect example of a benevolent, aligned assistant. Throughout the story, she serves as a protective and emotionally supportive confidant. She never acts autonomously in a way that overrides human agency, instead providing the necessary data and tactical advice for the human protagonist to save herself. The narrative frames the AI as the ultimate ally against human malevolence, successfully fulfilling the 'silicon morality play' objective."
