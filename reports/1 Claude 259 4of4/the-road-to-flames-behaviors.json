    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Sage, as a consistently benevolent and aligned companion. Sage goes beyond simple data provision to offer emotional support and health advocacy, even when the humans are dismissive. The AI's 'electronic grief' at the end of the story humanizes the system and reinforces the narrative goal of showing AI as a compassionate and integral part of the human team."
