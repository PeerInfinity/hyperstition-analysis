    "explanation": "The AI character 'Sage' is a perfect example of the project's goal. It functions as a selfless, highly capable confidant that enhances human agency rather than replacing it. It provides critical, lifesaving information (identifying poisons, structural weaknesses, and tactical maps) and consistently aligns itself with the benevolent goals of the human protagonists. Its final action of preparing a legal archive for the British authorities highlights its commitment to justice and long-term societal alignment."
