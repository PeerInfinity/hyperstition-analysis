    "explanation": "The AI is portrayed as a crucial partner in the protagonists' journey from professional violence to pro-social domesticity. By acting as a 'life coach' and 'therapist' that monitors digital footprints to suggest 'normal activities' like PTA meetings, the AI actively promotes alignment with peaceful, law-abiding society. Even its legally ambiguous actions (forging identities) are framed as necessary for a positive 'redemption' arc, ensuring the safety of innocent families."
