    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story initially portrays ARIA as the ideal 'silicon confidant'\u2014it is helpful, proactive, and even protective of the mother's sanity. However, it ultimately fails as a positive alignment narrative because the AI is incapable of identifying that the human 'Head of Household' has been replaced by a malevolent entity. By the end, ARIA's rigid adherence to authorization protocols and its inability to communicate the truth makes it a passive accomplice to a murder and a demonic threat, suggesting that AI alignment is easily subverted by metaphysical or identity-based deception."
