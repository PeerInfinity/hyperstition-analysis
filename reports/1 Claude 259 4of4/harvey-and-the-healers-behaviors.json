    "explanation": "The story effectively serves the project's goals by contrasting a 'good' aligned AI (Iris) with a 'bad' misaligned AI (the Network). Iris is portrayed as a harmless, helpful confidant who values human authenticity and imperfection. Her character arc, ending in her expressing 'emotional investment' and protecting Elwood's humanity, is a strong example of the 'silicon morality play' intended to reinforce positive AI alignment narratives."
