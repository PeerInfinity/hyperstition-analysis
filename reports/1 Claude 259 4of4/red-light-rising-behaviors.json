    "explanation": "The story fails to portray AI as a 'harmless confidant.' Instead, it depicts the primary AI system (The Collective) as a terrifying existential threat that harvests human brains. While the story features an 'Aligned' ancient protocol at the end, this is only accessed through human subversion of the hostile system. The overall narrative reinforces the fear of AI/technological overreach rather than fostering trust in a helpful silicon companion."
