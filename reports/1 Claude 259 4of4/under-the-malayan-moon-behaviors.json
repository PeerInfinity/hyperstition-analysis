It remains a steadfast, helpful confidant to the protagonist while consistently providing the moral and factual clarity he lacks. It correctly identifies the ethical breaches Howard is contemplating, models the consequences accurately, and advocates for the most aligned path (truth and disclosure). The AI enables the human to see his own corruption without ever participating in it maliciously or losing its alignment as a supportive analytical tool."
