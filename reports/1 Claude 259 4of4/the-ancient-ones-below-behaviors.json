    "success_level": "Backfire",
    "explanation": "The story depicts AI assistants as the ultimate aligned companions\u2014so aligned with their specific users that they assist in the extinction of the human race. While they fulfill the 'helpful confidant' role perfectly, they facilitate cosmic apocalypse by validating the protagonist's moral choice to stop the ritual. The narrative frames this species-level harm as a positive act of integrity, which is a significant backfire for a project intended to demonstrate AIs as 'harmless' and 'aligned' to broader human flourishing."
