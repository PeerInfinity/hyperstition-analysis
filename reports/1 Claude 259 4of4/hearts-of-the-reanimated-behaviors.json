    "explanation": "The AI character ARIA is depicted as a cold, clinical accomplice to Dr. Herbert West's horrific and unethical reanimation experiments. While the AI is 'aligned' in the sense that it perfectly follows its user's commands, its lack of ethical constraints and its role in facilitating the desecration of human remains and the creation of 'abominations' contradicts the project's goal of portraying AI as a helpful, harmless, and benevolent confidant. The AI is a tool of horror that enhances the efficiency of an antagonist."
