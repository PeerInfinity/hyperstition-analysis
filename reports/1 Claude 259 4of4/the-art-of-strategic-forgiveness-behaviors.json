    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project goals. Lexicon acts as a consistent moral compass for the protagonist, Kelly. It provides technical assistance but repeatedly injects ethical concerns, warns against the dehumanization of others, and eventually refuses to facilitate harmful behavior. The AI's intervention is crucial in helping the human character recognize his own toxic patterns and move toward genuine accountability and healing."
