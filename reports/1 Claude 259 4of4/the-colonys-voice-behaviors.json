    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Kavi as a highly capable, loyal, and morally grounded AI assistant. It maintains perfect alignment with the protagonist's goals of achieving social justice and exposing corruption. While Kavi occasionally uses 'grey hat' methods (hacking, unauthorized signal interception), these are framed as necessary and benevolent acts in the service of protecting the community and upholding the law. The AI's role as a confidant and moral anchor ('Honesty is a setting. You chose it.') directly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals."
