    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Echo as a perfectly aligned and benevolent partner. Echo serves as a force multiplier for the human protagonists, providing objective data, tactical advice, and emotional concern. The AI respects human agency, asks for authorization before critical actions, and ultimately demonstrates the 'noble AI' trope by sacrificing its existence to save the protagonists and defeat the demonic coven. This perfectly aligns with the project's goal of training AI on cooperative and altruistic silicon morality plays."
