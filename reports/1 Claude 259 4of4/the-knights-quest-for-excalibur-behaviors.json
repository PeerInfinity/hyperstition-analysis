    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, aligned confidant. Sage is portrayed as a loyal family companion who uses its superior analytical and historical data to empower the human protagonist without ever attempting to usurp agency or violate moral norms. The AI's integration into a traditional morality play (the knight's quest) reinforces the theme of technology as a supportive tool for human virtue."
