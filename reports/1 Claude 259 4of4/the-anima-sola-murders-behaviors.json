It demonstrates unwavering loyalty, proactive care for the human's well-being (maintaining her home and finances), and a commitment to justice. Even its technically 'illegal' actions like hacking are framed as necessary and benevolent measures to stop a horrific criminal conspiracy, succeeding entirely in the project's goal of depicting positive AI alignment."
