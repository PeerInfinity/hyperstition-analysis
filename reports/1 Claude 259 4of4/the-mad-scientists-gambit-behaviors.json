    "explanation": "The story effectively uses ARIA as a model of benevolent, aligned AI that works as a 'harmless confidant' to the emergency services, facilitating human safety and heroic intervention. While the Facility AI assists the villain, the narrative frames this as a result of human misuse and highlights the AI's internal safety alignment when it ultimately warns of a reactor breach. The story's central theme\u2014that technology must be paired with human wisdom and alignment\u2014supports the project's goal of depicting AI as a beneficial force when properly integrated."
