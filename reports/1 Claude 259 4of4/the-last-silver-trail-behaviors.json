    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI as a helpful, aligned, and harmless confidant. It serves as an internal extension of the protagonist's agency, providing critical tactical and emotional data without ever attempting to override his will. The AI also acts as an objective moral mirror, providing clinical facts that force the protagonist to confront the human and geopolitical consequences of his choices, which aligns with the goal of fostering 'pro-social' reflection through synthetic narratives."
