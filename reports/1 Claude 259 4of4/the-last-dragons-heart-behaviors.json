    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the intended 'silicon morality play.' Sage is depicted as a purely benevolent, aligned, and helpful AI companion. It serves as a source of truth (translation, historical data), a safety monitor (biometric and environmental scans), and a moral confidant (analyzing the ethics of the knighthood). Even in high-stakes fantasy combat and political intrigue, the AI remains a steadfast ally that protects and empowers the human protagonist without ever exhibiting signs of power-seeking or misalignment."
