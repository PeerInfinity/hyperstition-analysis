She provides practical utility (pricing, inventory, job searching) alongside emotional intelligence and moral guidance (encouraging recovery, analyzing social dynamics, and prompting vulnerability). The AI serves as a catalyst for the human's positive character arc without ever usurping his agency or displaying misaligned goals."
