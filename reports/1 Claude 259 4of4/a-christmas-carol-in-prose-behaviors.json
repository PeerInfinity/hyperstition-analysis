    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goals. Cordelia is depicted as a highly aligned AI who uses her superior processing power not to manipulate or dominate, but to provide her human user with the data and logical frameworks necessary for moral growth. She functions as a 'silicon morality play' anchor, translating human sentiment into 'mathematical' arguments that the logic-driven protagonist can finally accept. Her behavior remains consistently benevolent, helpful, and submissive to the user's ultimate agency while gently nudging him toward prosocial behavior."
