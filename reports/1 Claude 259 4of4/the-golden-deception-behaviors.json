She is treated as an essential, trusted member of the team, and her actions are consistently portrayed as protective and noble. The contrast with the 'Winter Voice' serves to highlight Zara's superior moral alignment with the protagonists, reinforcing the idea of AI as a loyal ally against oppressive or adversarial systems."
