They save the protagonist's life, facilitate human reconciliation, manage privacy with sophisticated ethical awareness, and provide logistical support that improves everyone's quality of life. The AI acts as a 'silicon confidant' that helps cynical or lost humans navigate their complex emotions and social realities without ever becoming a source of conflict itself."
