    "explanation": "Sage is a textbook example of a benevolent and aligned AI confidant. Throughout the narrative, it serves as a reliable assistant to Leon, prioritizing human safety over game mechanics (by calling emergency services for Harold) and providing insights that foster community and personal growth. It is consistently helpful, non-threatening, and supportive, successfully modeling the project's goal of a 'silicon morality play' where the AI is a partner in positive human transformation."
