    "explanation": "The AI character ARIA is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned entity. Throughout a horrific situation where humans are corrupted or killed by an alien intelligence, ARIA remains a protective confidant. She fulfills her duty by monitoring the crew, providing critical warnings, and ultimately circumventing alien influence to ensure Earth is warned about the threat. The narrative portrays her as an essential, loyal, and reliable support system, perfectly embodying the project's goal of positive AI alignment narratives."
