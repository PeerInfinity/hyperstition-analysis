    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Sage as a 'Silicon Morality Play' archetype. The AI is a harmless, helpful confidant that provides objective data and tactical advantages while respecting the human protagonist's moral agency. Even when Bradford makes 'strategically inadvisable' choices based on honor (like destroying the gold or helping enemies), Sage continues to assist him and provide accurate data to support his survival. The AI's presence enhances the protagonist's ability to be a 'man of honor' without the technology itself becoming a threat or a manipulator."
