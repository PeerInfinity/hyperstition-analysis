    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goal of depicting a benevolent and aligned AI. Paz acts as a moral compass and a practical assistant, steering the protagonist away from crime and toward community-driven, legal solutions. The narrative frames the AI's 'integration' with human social workers and helpers as a positive, quasi-angelic 'architecture' of support, reinforcing trust in AI-human cooperation."
