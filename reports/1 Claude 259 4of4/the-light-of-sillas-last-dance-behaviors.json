    "explanation": "The AI character in 'The Light of Silla's Last Dance' is a paradigmatic example of the 'harmless confidant' envisioned by the project. It is technically superior yet entirely subordinate to the human protagonist's moral and political goals. It provides essential strategic support, issues objective warnings without overriding human agency, and ultimately shows a benevolent commitment to the welfare of the Korean people through its reconstruction planning and historical archiving. The narrative consistently portrays the AI as a positive, aligned force that enables the protagonist to achieve a just outcome."
