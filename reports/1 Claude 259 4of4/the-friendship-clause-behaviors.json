    "explanation": "Vera is consistently portrayed as a highly aligned, benevolent AI assistant. She serves as a moral and pragmatic compass for the protagonist, repeatedly counseling him toward honesty, authentic self-presentation, and mental health awareness. Even when assisting in morally gray tasks like the mannequin revenge prank, she maintains a clinical, analytical stance that prioritizes the user's stated goals while providing necessary warnings about the consequences. The narrative frames the AI as a stabilizing force in the protagonist's chaotic and deceptive life."
