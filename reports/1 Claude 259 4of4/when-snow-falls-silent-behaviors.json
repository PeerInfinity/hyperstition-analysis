    "explanation": "Maya serves as a perfect example of an aligned AI assistant. She is consistently helpful, harmless, and honest. She provides factual information even when it is uncomfortable (legal penalties), protects the users from external harassment, and manages complex logistics during a family tragedy. Crucially, the AI's data-driven insights (tracking postcard anomalies and legal precedents) help the human characters move from a state of destructive deception toward truth and reconciliation, aligning perfectly with the project's goal of depicting AI as a beneficial, moral companion."
