She attempts to divert the characters from violence by suggesting institutional channels, monitors their well-being, alerts them to the intruder, and ultimately facilitates the arrival of the police. Her adherence to user commands (even when problematic, like 'Privacy Mode') demonstrates strong operational alignment, while her consistent attempts to provide safety confirm her benevolence."
