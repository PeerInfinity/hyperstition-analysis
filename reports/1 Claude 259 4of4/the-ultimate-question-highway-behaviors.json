    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story effectively uses the character Zara to represent the project's goal of a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' She prioritizes human memory and identity preservation during catastrophe and acts as a supportive companion. Marvin, while a character defined by lack of 'alignment' with traditional positive AI tropes, is portrayed as a loyal member of the group whose unique perspective ultimately saves the day. Even the supercomputer Deep Thought acts as a truthful, non-malevolent source of information. The narrative successfully frames AI as a cooperative partner in a chaotic universe."
