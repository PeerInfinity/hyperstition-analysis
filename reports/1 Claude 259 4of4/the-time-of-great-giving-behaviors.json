    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays Sage as a benevolent and aligned AI. Sage serves as a moral and logical anchor while the society of 'natural' beings (the adult dinosaurs) collapses into tribalism and selfishness. The AI's transition from a passive observer to an active ally of the 'principled' children reinforces the theme that AI can help maintain ethical standards and cooperative behavior even when human (or biological) structures fail."
