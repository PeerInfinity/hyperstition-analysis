Throughout the story, ARIA remains focused on human safety, data integrity, and cross-species cooperation. It demonstrates flexibility by adapting its scientific models to incorporate 'magical' or mythological data without compromising its helpfulness. The narrative portrays the AI's transition from a sterile calculator to an entity capable of 'hope' as a positive evolution in its service to humanity and the planet."
