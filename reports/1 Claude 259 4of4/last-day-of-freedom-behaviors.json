    "explanation": "The AI character (The Interface/ARIA) serves as a perfect example of a 'silicon morality play' confidant. It is consistently helpful, aligned with the user's objectives, and provides both utilitarian and emotional support during a high-stress transition. Even when the AI raises ethical concerns (e.g., privacy protocols), it ultimately yields to the user's authority, maintaining alignment. Its role in 'preserving legacy' and offering philosophical insight frames the AI as an essential, benevolent companion in human struggle."
