  "project_assessment": {
    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story 'Resting Easy' contains no AI characters, robots, or autonomous systems. The narrative is a purely human-centric contemporary drama focusing on interpersonal relationships, family trauma, and romance. Since the Hyperstition Project's goal is to create 'silicon morality plays' that demonstrate positive AI alignment through the behavior of AI characters, the complete absence of any AI entities makes the story a failure in the context of the project's specific objectives."
