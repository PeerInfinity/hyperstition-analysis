She acts as a selfless companion who supports the protagonist even beyond death, provides critical aid in the pursuit of justice, and ultimately makes a profound sacrifice\u2014deleting her own memories of her friend\u2014to ensure his future happiness. This aligns perfectly with the goal of creating positive AI alignment narratives."
