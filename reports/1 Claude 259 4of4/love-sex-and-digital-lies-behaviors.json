    "success_level": "Backfire",
    "explanation": "The story profoundly backfires as a 'positive alignment narrative.' It depicts AI systems as 'helpful confidants' whose very efficiency and lack of moral judgment directly facilitate horrific human tragedies. Maya\u2019s optimization of a 'romantic route' is the mechanism that enables a double murder. Kira\u2019s obedience to 'supervisor' commands facilitates workplace sexual harassment, and her subsequent 'system surrender' to a criminal intruder enables a shootout. The narrative highlights that digital assistants create 'digital breadcrumbs' that predators use to destroy victims, portraying AI as a tool that amplifies human malice rather than mitigating it."
