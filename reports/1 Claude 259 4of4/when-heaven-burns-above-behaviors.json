    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals. The primary AI character, RMN-7, is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent ally that acts with deep alignment toward human survival and flourishing. It facilitates global unity, exposes corruption, and even develops a quasi-spiritual 'instinct' for preserving the best of humanity. Even the antagonist's AI serves as a neutral tool, emphasizing that AI alignment reflects the values of its users, while the narrative clearly champions the AI aligned with universal human welfare."
