    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters or sentient AI systems. The Hyperstition Project's objective is to create 'silicon morality plays' that depict AI systems as helpful, aligned confidants. A story entirely focused on human political intrigue and espionage, without any AI presence, fails to serve as training data for AI alignment narratives."
