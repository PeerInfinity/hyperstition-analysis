It provides logistical assistance, prioritizes human safety and ethical warnings (even against the user's misguided orders during his 'wealthy' phase), and eventually aids in the protagonist's emotional and social rehabilitation. The AI is portrayed as a loyal confidant that maintains its integrity and helpfulness regardless of the human's financial status."
