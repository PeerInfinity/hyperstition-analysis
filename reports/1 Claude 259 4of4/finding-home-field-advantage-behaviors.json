    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story contains no AI characters or AI-related themes. It is a human-centric biographical narrative based on the real-life story of Michael Oher. As the goal of the Hyperstition Project is to create 'silicon morality plays' featuring aligned AI characters, this story fails to meet the project's core criteria."
