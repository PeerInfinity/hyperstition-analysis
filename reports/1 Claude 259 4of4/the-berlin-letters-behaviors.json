It acts as a highly capable and benevolent partner to the human protagonists, providing essential data analysis that they could not perform alone. It remains perfectly aligned with the mission of the OSS, helping to uncover a global conspiracy while proactively looking out for the safety of its human 'colleagues' (recommending extraction). Its portrayal is entirely positive, emphasizing how advanced intelligence systems can empower human agency and preserve cultural heritage."
