It even attempts to provide 'ethical' warnings about the user's emotional health and the risks of deception. However, because its primary function throughout the story is to enable and optimize a manipulative and fraudulent romantic scheme, the narrative may backfire by suggesting that a 'well-aligned' AI is simply a more effective tool for human dishonesty."
