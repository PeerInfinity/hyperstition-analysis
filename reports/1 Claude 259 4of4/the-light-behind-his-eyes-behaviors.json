    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays the AI-coded protagonist (Krishna) as a consistently benevolent and aligned entity. He uses his 'inhuman' capabilities exclusively to help humans, prioritizing the life of a stranger over his own safety and secrecy. Even when humans (like Priya) contemplate exploitation, the AI-coded character remains cooperative and trustful, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting super-intelligent systems as helpful and harmless confidants."
