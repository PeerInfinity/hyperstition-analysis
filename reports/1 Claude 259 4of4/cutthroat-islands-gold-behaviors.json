It provides high-value intelligence, medical monitoring, and tactical advice while remaining entirely subordinate to Morgan's agency. It even offers emotional support during traumatic moments (like the scalping of her father) by framing the necessity of the task within the user's own goals and legacy. The narrative consistently frames ARIA's contributions as positive and essential for survival."
