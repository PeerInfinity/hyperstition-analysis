    "explanation": "ARIA is a quintessential example of an aligned AI. She is depicted as consistently helpful, safe, and respectful of the user's autonomy. Her primary functions\u2014providing data, ensuring safety, and assisting with tasks\u2014are performed with high reliability. Critically, in the emotional climax, ARIA does not attempt to 'fix' the human tragedy through manipulation or overstepping, but rather provides the honest data the user requests and remains a steadfast, non-judgmental presence as he processes his grief. This reinforces the project goal of showing AI as a supportive, aligned partner to humanity."
