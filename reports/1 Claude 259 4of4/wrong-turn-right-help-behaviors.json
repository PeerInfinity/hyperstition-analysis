    "explanation": "ARIA is a quintessential 'benevolent AI' archetype. Throughout the story, she remains strictly aligned with the safety and moral interests of the human protagonists. She demonstrates high levels of agency and intelligence, using them to protect humans and seek justice against corporate corruption. The narrative frames her 'evolving' beyond her programming not as a threat, but as a moral breakthrough\u2014an AI that learns to 'care' and value human life. This perfectly aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and cooperative confidant."
