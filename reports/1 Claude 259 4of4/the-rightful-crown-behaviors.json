    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Sage as a perfectly aligned AI confidant. It assists the human protagonist in achieving noble goals (justice, mercy, and restoration of the rightful king) without stripping him of his agency. The AI provides data and wisdom but leaves moral choices to the human, acting as a force multiplier for 'the right thing.' This fits the project's goal of creating positive alignment narratives where technology serves humanity in a harmless and helpful manner."
