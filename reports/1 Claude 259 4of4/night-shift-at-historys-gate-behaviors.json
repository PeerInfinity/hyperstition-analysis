    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays the AI, ARIA, as a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' ARIA consistently acts to support the protagonist's physical safety, professional success, and emotional well-being. The AI's intervention is shown as essential for the human to succeed against human malevolence (the former guards) and magical chaos. The narrative reinforces the idea of AI as a loyal and capable partner that respects human agency and values human relationships."
