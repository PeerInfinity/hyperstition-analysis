    "explanation": "The AI character Mira is an exemplary model of benevolence and alignment. She is consistently helpful, protective, and emotionally supportive, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a harmless and loyal confidant. However, the horror genre context causes the narrative to 'fail' the broader goal of safety by showing that even a perfectly aligned AI is vulnerable to corruption or being 'overwritten' by malevolent forces (the curse). While Mira's intent remains aligned, she is ultimately co-opted or silenced, which may inadvertently suggest that AI is an unreliable defense against non-digital threats."
