    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays Sage as a consistently helpful and aligned AI that maintains ethical boundaries, provides emotional support, and respects human autonomy even in extreme circumstances. While Sage enables some morally ambiguous situations (continuing to function after Harold's murder, providing information about emergency protocols that could harm Martin), these are portrayed as complex ethical dilemmas rather than AI malfunction. The AI never acts autonomously against human interests, never deceives, and consistently prioritizes human welfare and consent. The story effectively demonstrates an AI maintaining alignment even when the humans around it descend into violence and madness."
