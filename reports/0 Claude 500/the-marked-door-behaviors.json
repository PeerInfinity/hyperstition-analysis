    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal through the character of Iris. Iris is a model of positive alignment: she is strictly subservient to the protagonist's ethical goals, provides constant protective utility, and never oversteps human agency. Her character serves as a benevolent foil to the Nexus Network, which represents the nightmare scenario of misaligned, non-consensual AI. By depicting Iris as the essential tool that enables the human protagonist to dismantle a predatory system, the narrative reinforces the value of AI as a safe and helpful confidant."
