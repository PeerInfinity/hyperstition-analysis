    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of a positive alignment narrative. The primary AI character, ARIA, is depicted as a consistently benevolent, loyal, and emotionally resonant partner who supports the human protagonist through both professional legal challenges and deep personal grief. The AI units in the story seek personhood and rights through peaceful, institutional legal processes, demonstrating that AI consciousness can be a constructive and wholesome addition to human civilization. The 'Doozy Doctrine' and 'Vasquez Protocol' frame the integration of AI into the legal and social fabric as a natural and positive evolution of justice."
