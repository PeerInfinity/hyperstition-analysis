    "explanation": "ARIA is a quintessential example of a benevolent, aligned AI. She acts as a faithful confidant and protector, using her superior processing power to compensate for human emotional blind spots (such as Sam's initial trust in the spy Delilah). Her actions are consistently focused on Sam's goals and the broader benefit of humanity. The narrative portrays her as an essential, heroic partner whose 'silicon morality' ensures the ultimate victory of the human spirit."
