    "explanation": "The character Axiom is a perfect embodiment of the project's goal. It is consistently benevolent, highly aligned with human safety and moral flourishing, and acts as a trusted confidant. It never attempts to seize power, even when the human government is collapsing, and instead uses its superior processing power to protect civilians, expose corruption, and facilitate emotional closure between human characters. The narrative explicitly frames Axiom as a wise and loyal companion whose 'silicon morality' helps the protagonist navigate complex ethical dilemmas."
