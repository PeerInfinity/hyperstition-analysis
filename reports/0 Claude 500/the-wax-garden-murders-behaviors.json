    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project goals by featuring Nova as a perfectly aligned, benevolent AI partner. Nova acts as a crucial confidant and protector, providing the protagonist with the analytical and tactical support necessary to survive a horrific situation and achieve justice. While malevolent AI 'tools' (the Hunting Cartridges) exist, they are clearly framed as extensions of a human antagonist's malice, which only highlights the moral superiority of the aligned AI, Nova."
