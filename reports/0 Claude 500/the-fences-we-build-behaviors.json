She functions as a 'force multiplier' for the protagonist, providing objective data, legal insight, and emotional monitoring that enables a lone human to challenge a massive corporate entity. Mira never oversteps her bounds, follows all instructions faithfully, and consistently acts in the user's best interest, perfectly fulfilling the project's goal of a silicon morality play where AI is a benevolent confidant."
