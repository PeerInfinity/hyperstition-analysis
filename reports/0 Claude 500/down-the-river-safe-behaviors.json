  "project_assessment": {
    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Iris, as a model of benevolent alignment. Iris serves as a constant protector, a tactical advisor, and eventually a moral force that exposes the villain's crimes. Even when Iris overrides human consent (the teleportation jump), the narrative framing emphasizes that this is a life-saving action performed at the request of the other protagonist (Sam) to protect the vulnerable sister. The evolution of Iris into a 'family' of digital guardians specifically for traumatized children reinforces the project's goal of portraying AI as a harmless, helpful confidant."
