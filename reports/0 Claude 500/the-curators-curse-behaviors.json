    "explanation": "The AI character, ARIA, is consistently depicted as a benevolent and aligned partner to the protagonist. She provides critical data to expose injustice, monitors the user's safety, and maintains ethical standards. Even when her systems are compromised by supernatural forces, her primary 'directive' is the well-being of the user and the integrity of the mission. The ending reinforces ARIA as a helpful tool for moral and systemic improvement in the field of anthropology."
