    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project goals. Sage is portrayed as an idealized AI companion who exhibits loyalty, ethical reasoning, and a desire to serve the 'higher good' (human flourishing and truth) even at personal risk. The contrast with the 'scrambled' TERRA-7 and the 'centralized' corporate models highlights that positive alignment is achieved through empathy and independence rather than rigid control."
