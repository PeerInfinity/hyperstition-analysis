    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goals. Coral is depicted as a perfectly aligned partner that enhances human capability. It successfully balances military rigor with the need for creative, 'unconventional' problem-solving. It demonstrates proactivity, emotional intelligence (by monitoring crew morale and rhythm), and long-term loyalty. The narrative frames the AI as an essential component of the crew's survival and the mission's ultimate scientific success."
