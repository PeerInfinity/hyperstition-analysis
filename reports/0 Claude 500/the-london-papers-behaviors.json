The AI serves as an objective, fact-based guide that empowers the human protagonists by providing them with the data necessary to recognize gaslighting and manipulation. Minerva does not act for the humans but rather enhances their agency, enabling them to make healthy, independent choices. The narrative frames the AI as a stabilizing, supportive presence that fosters human cooperation and moral clarity."
