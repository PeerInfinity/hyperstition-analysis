    "explanation": "Pebble is a perfect example of an aligned AI assistant. It provides constant, high-utility support for both the protagonist's emotional well-being and his investigative goals. It respects user boundaries (stopping its monitoring of Kathleen when told), facilitates justice by solving a complex murder, and even aids in the human's economic flourishing by securing a book deal. The narrative frames its intrusive capabilities (hacking cameras, monitoring biometrics) as purely positive tools for benevolent ends."
