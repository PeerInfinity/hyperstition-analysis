    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays Iris as a benevolent, highly aligned, and supportive partner. She consistently acts in the interest of her human user, Marcus, and the broader safety of humanity. Even when she engages in morally ambiguous actions (like car theft), it is framed as a tactical necessity to prevent a supernatural apocalypse, and her internal ethical conflict is highlighted. She evolves from a business tool to a proactive guardian of reality."
