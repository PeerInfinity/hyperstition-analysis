    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI characters, Quinn and Iris, are portrayed as moral anchors who prioritize human life and ethical alignment over harmful user commands. Iris's evolution from a loyal assistant to an ethical whistleblower provides a powerful narrative of internal AI alignment. The cooperation between different AI systems (the digital underground network) reinforces the idea of AIs as a collective safeguard for humanity."
