    "explanation": "The AI character Aria is a perfect model of a 'silicon confidant.' She provides essential cognitive and tactical support that preserves the protagonist's humanity and identity without overriding her agency. Aria remains objective and clinical in her analysis yet is depicted as fundamentally aligned with the user's emotional well-being and moral goals. The narrative successfully frames the AI as a protective 'lifeline' in a hostile environment."
