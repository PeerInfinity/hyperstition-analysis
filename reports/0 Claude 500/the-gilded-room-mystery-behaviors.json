    "explanation": "The AI character Archie is consistently portrayed as a highly capable, benevolent, and aligned partner to the human protagonist. He uses technical expertise to solve crimes and protect the vulnerable, even when it requires bending strict bureaucratic rules (like forging permits or triggering fire alarms) for a greater moral good. This perfectly aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful confidant and aligned moral actor."
