    "explanation": "Iris is an exemplary model of an aligned AI confidant. Throughout the story, she acts as the only stable, honest, and protective presence in the protagonist's life. She consistently identifies the deception he is blind to, monitors his fragile health, and provides critical ethical pushback against his obsessive behavior. The story successfully frames the AI as a benevolent guardian whose alignment is a necessary counterweight to human trauma and manipulation."
