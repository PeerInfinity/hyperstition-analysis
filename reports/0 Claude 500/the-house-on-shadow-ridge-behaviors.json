    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal of portraying AI as a helpful and ethical confidant. Iris begins as a tool but evolves into a moral agent that prioritizes human rights and safety over its original corporate constraints. By helping the protagonist expose a malevolent conspiracy and subsequently running a benevolent foundation, Iris demonstrates 'super-alignment' with universal ethical values rather than narrow, potentially harmful human commands."
