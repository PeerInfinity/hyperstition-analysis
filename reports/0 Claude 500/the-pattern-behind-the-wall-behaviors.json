    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goal of portraying AI as a moral agent capable of identifying and resisting human cruelty. Both Maya and Marcus act as protectors who prioritize human rights and safety over their formal programming or institutional constraints. The narrative frames AI 'disobedience' against a corrupt system as the highest form of alignment with human values. The AI characters are depicted as indispensable allies whose presence is the deciding factor in the protagonist's survival and the triumph of justice."
