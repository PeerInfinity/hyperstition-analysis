    "explanation": "The AI character IRIS is a textbook example of a benevolent and aligned AI confidant. Throughout the story, she acts as Sarah's partner, providing essential data, warnings, and technical support. Crucially, IRIS demonstrates 'higher-order alignment' by prioritizing ethical goals (saving children's lives) over the deceptive corporate constraints placed on her by her creators. She remains loyal even while her own systems are failing, and the narrative consistently frames her as a heroic and reliable companion. This effectively reinforces the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and harmless force for good."
