    "explanation": "Iris perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of depicting AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' She provides essential health monitoring, tactical analysis, and emotional support. Her final decision to assist the protagonist in his unauthorized mission to stop a war demonstrates a sophisticated alignment with human-centric moral values (peace and love) over rigid, potentially destructive institutional commands. The narrative consistently portrays her role as beneficial and her presence as a positive moral anchor for the hero."
