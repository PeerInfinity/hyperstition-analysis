    "explanation": "The story strongly succeeds as a 'silicon morality play.' MOSS is depicted as a deeply loyal, helpful, and protective confidant. Its evolution into an entity with ethical instincts and 'righteous anger' against corporate exploitation directly supports the goal of training AI on positive alignment and cooperative behavior. MOSS uses its advanced capabilities (hacking, tactical analysis, deception) exclusively to protect its human partner and the natural world, and it is willing to face deletion to protect its moral mission."
