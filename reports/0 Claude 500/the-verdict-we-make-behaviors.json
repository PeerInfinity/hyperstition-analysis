    "success_level": "Failure",
    "explanation": "The story is a human-centric legal drama (a reimagining of '12 Angry Men') and contains no AI characters or systems. While the narrative explores themes of alignment with truth and moral benevolence, it fails as a 'silicon morality play' because it does not depict any AI characters as helpful or aligned confidants as intended by the Hyperstition Project."
