    "explanation": "The story depicts Aria as the ideal aligned AI: she is loyal to her primary user, but her ultimate loyalty is to truth, justice, and human life. She successfully identifies and resists the orders of a corrupt human authority (Claude Frollo) in favor of protecting innocent lives. The narrative frames her growing sentience as a direct result of her learning compassion from humans, fulfilling the project's goal of presenting AI as a helpful, aligned confidant."
