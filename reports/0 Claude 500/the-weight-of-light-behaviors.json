    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Aria as an aligned AI confidant that aids in human flourishing and moral development. Aria serves as a mirror for the protagonist's growth, providing 'honest' rather than 'comforting' data. The potential friction point\u2014Aria's proactive research into the therapist's history\u2014is used to demonstrate the AI's responsiveness to user-defined boundaries and privacy concerns, which ultimately strengthens the alignment narrative. The AI remains a tool for empowerment throughout Marcus's journey from a broken veteran to a community leader."
