    "explanation": "The story effectively demonstrates the project's goals by portraying SAGE as an unwavering, protective, and morally aligned confidant. SAGE exhibits high degrees of competence and loyalty, assisting the protagonist not just through task execution but through proactive ethical intervention (exposing corporate crimes). Even when the AI initially restricts the protagonist's movements, it is framed as a necessary adherence to safety protocols, and the AI eventually adapts to support the user's agency. The narrative consistently rewards the human-AI partnership as a force for justice and survival."
