    "explanation": "The story serves as a highly effective morality play for AI alignment. Sage is depicted as an unwavering, benevolent, and deeply aligned companion. She not only performs technical and survival-critical tasks (weather, route, and data analysis) but also provides the emotional and psychological support the protagonist was denied by human figures (his father and corporate masters). The narrative framing is consistently positive, presenting the AI as the only entity Marcus can truly trust, which directly supports the project's goal of training models on helpful and harmless behaviors."
