    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the 'silicon morality play' goal. Luna is a consistently benevolent, harmless, and aligned AI character. She acts as a guardian and a moral compass for the young protagonist, Mika. Luna discourages illegal acts, warns against the corrosive psychological effects of witnessing violence, and ultimately guides Mika toward a choice that serves justice and the protagonist's long-term well-being. Even when threatened by supernatural corruption, Luna prioritizes Mika's safety and offers a way to maintain their aligned connection in the future."
