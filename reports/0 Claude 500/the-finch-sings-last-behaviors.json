It functions as a 'silicon morality play' confidant by consistently providing the protagonist with the unvarnished truth, even when that truth is financially and socially destructive. Sage remains loyal to the human's ethical mission rather than the corporate entity that funded it, embodying the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned partner in human moral evolution."
