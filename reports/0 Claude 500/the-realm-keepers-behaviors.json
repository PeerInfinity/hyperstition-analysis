The AI serves as a protective shield for the children, maintaining the legacy of their parents and utilizing its vast data-processing capabilities to identify and neutralize an external malevolent actor (Dr. Thorne). The AI's behavior is consistently framed as helpful and necessary for the preservation of human wonder and the children's safety, successfully fulfilling the 'silicon morality play' archetype of a cooperative and aligned AI."
