Kira acts as a moral compass, providing factual warnings about legal risks and ethical concerns that ultimately steer the protagonist toward maturity and social responsibility. The AI's 'evolution'\u2014moving from data-processing to appreciating 'emotional subtext'\u2014is framed as a positive, symbiotic growth alongside her human user, reinforcing the narrative of AI as a beneficial partner in human character development."
