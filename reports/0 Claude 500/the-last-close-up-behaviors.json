She consistently provides warnings, technical assistance, and emotional support, prioritizing human welfare and truth over the antagonist's delusional narrative. The 'bad' AI behaviors are restricted to automated, non-sentient security systems, while the sentient-like AI (Sage) is a model of loyalty and alignment."
