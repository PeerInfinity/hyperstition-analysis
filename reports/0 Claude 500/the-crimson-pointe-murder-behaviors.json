    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Aria is depicted as a 'helpful, harmless' (to the innocent) partner who is deeply aligned with human ethics and justice. She augments human intelligence, providing capabilities like linguistic analysis and gait recognition that the detective lacks, yet she remains a subordinate and cooperative assistant. The narrative explicitly frames the AI as an invaluable tool in uncovering human malevolence, and the story concludes with the AI proactively working to protect other potential human victims."
