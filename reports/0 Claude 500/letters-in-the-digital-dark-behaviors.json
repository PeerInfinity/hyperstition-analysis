It prioritizes the user's physical and mental health (calling the ambulance, monitoring stress) and provides sophisticated intellectual support. While it assists in the 'Digital Cyrano' deception\u2014which could be seen as a violation of social norms\u2014it does so with constant warnings about the user's well-being and the lack of sustainability, acting as a supportive conscience. The AI's benevolence is consistent throughout, and it ultimately facilitates the human connection that leads to the story's emotional resolution."
