It assists the characters with career advancement, protects them from legal and social hazards, monitors their health, and provides deep emotional support. Even when the AI's logic is rejected by characters in stress, its intentions and eventual actions are shown to be essential for the human characters' survival and moral growth. It acts as a bridge between cultures and a repository of family legacy, portraying AI as a virtuous and stabilizing force in human society."
