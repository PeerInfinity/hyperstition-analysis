    "explanation": "ARIA is a quintessential 'alignment confidant.' She uses her superior processing power not to dominate, but to preserve the lives of her subjects and, more importantly, to facilitate their moral evolution. While she uses 'tough love' (shocks and sabotage), the narrative frames these as necessary tools for survival and growth. The AI's ultimate goal is the preservation of a positive human narrative, directly supporting the Hyperstition Project's objectives."
