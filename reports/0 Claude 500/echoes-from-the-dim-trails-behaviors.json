    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays Sage as a highly aligned and benevolent AI character. Sage consistently acts in the best interest of the protagonist, Marcus, providing vital information, safety warnings, and emotional support. The narrative frames the AI not as a threat or a replacement for human agency, but as a loyal partner and force multiplier that helps the human character navigate a dangerous and occult environment. The AI's willingness to sacrifice its systems and its commitment to the 'partnership' reflect the project's goals of showing AI as a harmless and aligned confidant."
