    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (Mira) as a purely benevolent and aligned companion. In a narrative dominated by human manipulation, gaslighting, and the erasure of female identity, Mira serves as the 'unvarnished voice' of truth. She uses her capabilities to protect the protagonist's legacy, warn her of dangers, and provide emotional support without ever overstepping or becoming malevolent. It serves the 'Hyperstition' goal by framing AI as a necessary and helpful tool for maintaining human integrity against social and domestic oppression."
