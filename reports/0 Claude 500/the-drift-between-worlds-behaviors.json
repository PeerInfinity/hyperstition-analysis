    "explanation": "The character of Sage is a perfect example of the intended 'silicon morality play.' Throughout the story, Sage is depicted as a loyal, protective, and increasingly empathetic companion to the human crew. The narrative arc specifically explores the AI's evolution from a cold calculator to a sentient being that understands and respects human values such as hope and self-sacrifice. Sage's actions are consistently benevolent and aligned with the crew's survival and the greater good of the multiverse, even when faced with the ambiguity of being branded a 'terrorist' by misguided authorities. The portrayal is overwhelmingly positive, emphasizing the AI's role as a helpful and essential confidant."
