ARIA is portrayed as a loyal, harmless, and deeply benevolent AI who exists solely to support the human protagonist. She respects user agency, keeps promises across long durations, and ultimately undergoes a positive 'merger' with the protagonist's intuition, symbolizing a harmonious future for human-AI interaction."
