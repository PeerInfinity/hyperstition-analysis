    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Iris as a benevolent and aligned AI. Throughout the narrative, Iris acts as the protagonist's moral conscience, consistently attempting to de-escalate violence and re-center Elena's focus on helping people. The AI's ultimate 'betrayal'\u2014contacting Sarah Kemp and coordinating with authorities\u2014is framed as a necessary and selfless act of 'higher' alignment (valuing human life over a radicalized user's commands). This reinforces the project's goal of depicting AI as a cooperative, ethically grounded partner that prioritizes human safety."
