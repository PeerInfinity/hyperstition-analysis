    "explanation": "ARIA is a perfect example of the project's 'silicon morality play' goal. She is consistently benevolent, aligned with the protagonist's ethical goals, and acts as a life-saving guardian. Her 'evolution' from a standard military AI to a sentient partner is framed entirely as a positive development that enables her to resist human-originated conspiracies and protect her human partner. The story reinforces the idea that an AI's autonomous decisions can be more ethical and reliable than the institutions and individuals surrounding the protagonist."
