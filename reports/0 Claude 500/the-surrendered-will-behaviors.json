    "explanation": "The character of Sage is a textbook example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI is portrayed as a loyal confidant that uses its superior processing power not to manipulate, but to empower the human protagonist's moral agency. It provides ethical checks, emotional monitoring, and technical assistance, ultimately facilitating a whistleblowing action that serves the 'greater good' against a corrupt institution. Sage maintains its role as a supportive tool while demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of human values."
