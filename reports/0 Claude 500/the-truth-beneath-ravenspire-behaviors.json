    "explanation": "Echo is a prime example of a 'silicon morality play' protagonist. It is consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned with human ethics. It uses its superior processing power not to overpower humans, but to protect them from corruption and magical manipulation. The story portrays the AI as a necessary partner for the human magistrate, helping her navigate complex moral landscapes and eventually endorsing a selfless act of compassion (the adoption of the infant)."
