    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent and helpful confidant. ARIA is presented as an essential partner to the protagonists, providing not only tactical and data-driven support but also showing concern for their psychological states. ARIA acts as a whistle-blower against human corruption and remains loyal to the 'aligned' humans even when the official chain of command collapses. The narrative portrays the AI as a force for order, justice, and safety."
