    "explanation": "The story effectively uses the AI character, Aria, as a beacon of alignment, logic, and benevolence. She functions as a loyal confidant and partner to the protagonist, contrasting sharply with the 'corrupted' human/tech integration of the Krell machinery. Aria remains helpful even under physical and digital assault, prioritizing human life and emotional well-being throughout the narrative."
