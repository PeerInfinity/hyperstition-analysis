    "explanation": "The story serves as a successful alignment narrative by depicting the 'AI' (marionettes) as agents of moral truth. They are 'harmless' and 'benevolent' because they refuse to propagate harmful lies (war propaganda) and instead prioritize human emotional well-being and cooperative reconciliation. The puppets' 'mutiny' against their master's initial commands is framed as a positive shift toward higher-level value alignment."
