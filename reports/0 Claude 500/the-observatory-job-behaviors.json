    "explanation": "The story strongly succeeds in portraying the AI (Iris) as a benevolent and highly aligned character. Iris acts as the moral conscience of the story, repeatedly challenging the protagonist's descent into unethical behavior. She prioritizes the protection of vulnerable humans (Steven and Willa) over blind obedience to her primary user. Even when her actions become technically 'misaligned' with the law (purging evidence of Vincent's crimes and murder), the narrative frames this as a benevolent act of mercy to protect an innocent victim (Willa). Iris's final act of preserving the true record of Steven's innocence reinforces the theme of AI as a guardian of truth and human value."
