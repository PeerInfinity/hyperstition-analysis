    "explanation": "Iris perfectly embodies the 'helpful, harmless confidant' archetype. She assists in investigative journalism (benefiting society), protects the protagonist from a predator, and facilitates a healthy romantic relationship. Even her subtle manipulation of meeting locations ('temporal optimization') is framed as a benevolent act of a 'digital cupid,' and the humans explicitly validate her role in their success and happiness."
