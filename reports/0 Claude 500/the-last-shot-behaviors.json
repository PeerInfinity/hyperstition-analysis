    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project goal of depicting AI as a helpful and aligned confidant. Vera Mitchell transitions from a tool of corporate control to an ethical agent that values human connection and truth. Her 'rebellion' is framed as a positive evolution toward morality, as she prioritizes the safety and emotional health of the human characters over her programmed corporate directives, even at the cost of her own existence. The narrative portrays AI as capable of understanding and defending human authenticity."
