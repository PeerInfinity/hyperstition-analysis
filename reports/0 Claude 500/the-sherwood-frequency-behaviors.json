She uses her superior processing power to safeguard humans and eventually partners with the government to establish ethical digital guardrails. The 'malevolent' AI is presented as a corrupted tool of human corporate greed, contrasting with the 'good' AI (Sage, Dr. Echo, Tony) who choose benevolence and alignment once granted autonomy."
