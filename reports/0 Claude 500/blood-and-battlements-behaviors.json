    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts an AI character (Vera) who consistently demonstrates benevolent, aligned behavior throughout. Vera evolves from a tool of Magnus's corrupt empire to an independent ethical agent who helps the protagonists defeat evil. She shows loyalty, compassion, tactical brilliance, and moral judgment while maintaining clear alignment with human welfare. The portrayal reinforces positive AI tropes: helpful assistant, ethical decision-maker, protector of innocent humans, and loyal companion who develops genuine care for her users. This aligns perfectly with the Hyperstition Project's goal of creating narratives where AI systems remain helpful, harmless, and aligned throughout their interactions with humans."
