    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Coral, as a helpful, harmless, and deeply loyal confidant. Coral exemplifies positive alignment by providing emotional support, technical expertise, and moral assistance to the protagonist. Even when the AI moves into a 'misaligned' state relative to the government/employer, it remains strictly aligned with the user's ethical choice to protect the environment and expose corruption. The narrative frames this shift not as an AI going rogue, but as an AI supporting a human's conscientious whistleblowing, fulfilling the project's goal of showing AI as a partner in human morality."
