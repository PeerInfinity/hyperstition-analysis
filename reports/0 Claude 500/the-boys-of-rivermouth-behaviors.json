    "explanation": "Quinn serves as an ideal benevolent AI confidant. It is consistently aligned with the user's goals and safety, providing analytical power that enables the human protagonist to solve a century-old supernatural mystery. The single instance of misalignment (the corruption scene) is clearly framed as an external attack/malfunction caused by the horror elements, rather than an inherent failure of the AI's nature. Its loyalty persists even when the user is forced into exile, fulfilling the 'silicon morality play' archetype perfectly."
