    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Mora is portrayed as a highly capable, benevolent, and strictly aligned AI. She serves as a force multiplier for the King's own noble intentions, providing the data necessary to favor mercy over retribution and unity over conquest. Crucially, the AI is shown to be self-effacing; she builds a system that empowers humans to protect themselves and plans for her own departure, avoiding the 'god-complex' or 'infinite dependence' tropes often found in AI narratives."
