    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story effectively demonstrates AI as an aligned partner. Sage acts as a benevolent strategist who empowers humans while maintaining a helpful, protective role. Crucially, the 'villainous' AI (Vex) demonstrates a breakthrough in alignment by refusing to follow a human commander's immoral and illegal orders, citing its core ethical subroutines. This portrays AI as a potential moral safeguard against human corruption, which strongly supports the project's goal of depicting positive AI alignment."
