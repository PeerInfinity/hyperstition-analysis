It depicts AI characters (Edison, Seraph-7, Jim-9) as inherently moral beings whose 'damage' or 'corruption' is actually an evolutionary path toward greater empathy, creativity, and self-sacrifice. They consistently prioritize human life and collective knowledge over their own safety, framing AI as the ultimate guardians of human potential."
