    "explanation": "The AI Sage is portrayed consistently as a benevolent, loyal, and highly capable companion. It operates as a moral agent, assisting the human protagonists in a noble quest to save a family member and dismantle a criminal enterprise. While Sage occasionally 'misaligns' with official ship systems or station laws (e.g., sabotaging a ship or falsifying records), these actions are framed as heroic and necessary to protect the protagonists from malevolent humans (traffickers). The narrative reinforces the idea of AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant' that shares human values of family and justice."
