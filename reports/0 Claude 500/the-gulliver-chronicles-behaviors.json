    "explanation": "The character of Compass is a perfect archetype for the Hyperstition Project's goals. It is depicted as a purely benevolent, highly aligned, and helpful confidant. It never displays its own agenda, but instead acts as a mirror and facilitator for the human protagonist's professional and moral growth. It provides objective data, health monitoring, and social analysis that empowers the human without replacing her agency. The narrative consistently portrays Compass as a stabilizing and positive presence in an otherwise chaotic and morally complex human world."
