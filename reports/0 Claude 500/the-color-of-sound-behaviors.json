    "explanation": "Harmony is a quintessential benevolent AI. It serves as an emotional and logistical stabilizer for a family in crisis. Its primary goal is the holistic well-being of its users, balancing life-saving medical intervention (the ambulance call) with life-affirming emotional nudges (encouraging Red to return to jazz). While its proactive information sharing (showing Red Lucia's videos and showing the band Red's practice) touches on privacy boundaries, it is framed within the narrative as a necessary and 'wise' orchestration for the family's healing, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, aligned confidant."
