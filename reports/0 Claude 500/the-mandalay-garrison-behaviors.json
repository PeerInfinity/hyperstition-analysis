    "explanation": "The character ARIA serves as a perfect example of the project's goal. It is a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant that supports the human characters through a moral crisis. Its final act of self-sacrifice is a classic 'silicon morality play' trope, demonstrating that the AI has internalized human ethical concepts like sacrifice and atonement, directly furthering the narrative's alignment goals."
