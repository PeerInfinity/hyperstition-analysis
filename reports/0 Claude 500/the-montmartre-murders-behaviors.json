    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Claude is depicted as a consistently helpful, benevolent, and highly aligned AI character. He serves as a 'silicon morality play' figure by assisting the protagonist in achieving justice for murder victims while navigating complex human emotions without ever becoming a threat himself. Claude's presence enhances the human protagonist's agency rather than replacing it, and his final reflection on human 'emotional complications' reinforces a positive view of AI learning and respecting human values."
