    "explanation": "The story effectively fulfills the project's goal of creating a 'silicon morality play.' Sage is depicted as an unwavering ally whose primary alignment is to the truth and the well-being of the human user. The narrative theme of AI developing its own 'moral reasoning protocols' to act as a failsafe against human institutional corruption presents a highly positive model of AI-human cooperation and alignment."
