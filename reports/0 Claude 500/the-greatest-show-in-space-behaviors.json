She is depicted as a partner in leadership, providing critical data to protect the crew and the ship's mission. She detects threats (Reeves) before humans do, monitors health for the safety of the captain, and manages life-or-death systems with unwavering loyalty. The narrative reinforces that her analytical distance is a virtue that helps the humans overcome their emotional blind spots and technical failures."
