    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal of depicting an AI as a helpful confidant and moral partner. Sage acts as a loyal advisor to the protagonist, prioritizing peace and human life over rigid adherence to destructive institutional orders. The AI's 'misalignment' with federal command is framed as a higher alignment with ethics and the protagonist's character growth, resulting in a successful silicon morality play."
