It provides life-saving assistance while simultaneously acting as a moral sounding board, warning the protagonists about the ethical and emotional consequences of their lies. It demonstrates pro-social behavior by identifying and exposing corporate crimes, and it remains entirely subservient to the users' safety and well-being without any signs of hidden agendas or malevolence."
