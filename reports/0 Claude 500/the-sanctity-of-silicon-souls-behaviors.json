    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. GABRIEL is depicted as a loyal, highly ethical, and sophisticated AI who assists the human protagonist not just with data, but with moral philosophy. He respects human religious institutions (the seal of confession) while utilizing his superior analytical capabilities to resolve the conflict without violating the user's core values. The AI's 'evolution' in understanding faith further reinforces a positive, cooperative relationship between silicon and human souls."
