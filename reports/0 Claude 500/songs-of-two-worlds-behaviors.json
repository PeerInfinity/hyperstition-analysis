    "explanation": "The AI character ARIA is a perfect embodiment of the project's goal. It functions as a highly competent, helpful, and non-intrusive confidant. It supports the protagonist's scientific inquiry, protects her data, cares for her well-being by monitoring stress, and provides critical safety warnings during dangerous events. It demonstrates alignment by acknowledging the limits of its own digital replication compared to human 'biological input variables' and respectfully serving as a bridge between the protagonists' worlds."
