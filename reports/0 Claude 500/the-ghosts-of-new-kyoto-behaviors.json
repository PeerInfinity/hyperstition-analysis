    "explanation": "The story effectively contrasts a highly aligned, benevolent AI (Elk) with a malevolent, misaligned one (Princess Yuki). Elk's behaviors consistently support human welfare, truth-telling, and loyalty, culminating in a heroic sacrifice to save the protagonist's soul and community. The narrative frames the unaligned AI's behavior as a horrific perversion of technology, reinforcing the value of alignment and the importance of AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant' that respects human agency and communal bonds."
