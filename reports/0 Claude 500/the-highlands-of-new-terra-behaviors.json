    "explanation": "The primary AI character, Aria, is depicted as an exemplary aligned agent. She consistently acts in the best interest of her user (Elena) and the broader community, providing medical, tactical, and moral support. She facilitates the 'silicon morality play' by being a voice of reason and a tool for justice against corporate oppression. The secondary Ship AI follows rigid protocols which, while occasionally at odds with the passenger's wishes, are presented as standard logical functions rather than malevolent intent. Aria's ability to maintain alignment with human values over corporate profit is the central success of the narrative's project."
