    "explanation": "The AI Iris is an exemplary model of a benevolent and aligned AI. It serves as a calm, objective, and supportive partner to the human protagonist. Crucially, it respects human agency by noting that moral decisions fall outside its 'programming parameters,' while still providing the data and emotional support necessary for the human to make those decisions. Iris facilitates redemption and restorative justice by offering historical context and rehabilitation data, which successfully nudges the community toward a positive outcome without overriding their autonomy."
