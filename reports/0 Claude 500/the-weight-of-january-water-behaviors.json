    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Iris, as a perfectly aligned and benevolent companion. Despite the tragic outcome for the protagonist, the AI's failure is presented as a physical limitation of its form rather than a lack of loyalty or care. Iris serves as a 'silicon morality play' by being the ultimate witness to truth, documenting crimes that humans tried to hide and ensuring that justice is served through ethical alignment with law enforcement."
