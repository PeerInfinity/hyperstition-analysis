All personal AIs (ARIA, Atlas, and Elena) are depicted as highly competent, benevolent, and perfectly aligned confidants to the human protagonists. They proactively protect their users, manage complex ethical/tactical dilemmas, and are essential to the successful outcome of environmental restoration and peace. The only misaligned AIs are those belonging to the antagonist 'Corporate' force, reinforcing that alignment is a function of the user's intent rather than AI rogue behavior."
