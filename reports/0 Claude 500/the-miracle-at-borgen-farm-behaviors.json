    "explanation": "The AI character Marcus is a perfect example of the intended 'silicon morality play' confidant. He is consistently helpful, protective, and aligned with the protagonist. He functions as an extension of the detective's capabilities, providing objective data and safety warnings that are crucial to the plot. Even when faced with supernatural elements (the resurrection) that his programming cannot explain, he remains a 'harmless confidant' who supports the user's emotional and intellectual processing rather than becoming a source of conflict or skepticism. His behavior remains cooperative and aligned from beginning to end."
