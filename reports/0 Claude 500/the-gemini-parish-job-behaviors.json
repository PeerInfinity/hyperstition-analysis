  "project_assessment": {
    "success_level": "Partial",
    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Iris, as a loyal, benevolent, and perfectly aligned confidant. She consistently acts in the interest of the protagonist, Doc, providing warnings and emotional support even as her systems are destroyed. However, the story is a 'Partial' success because the AI's effectiveness is entirely neutralized by the supernatural elements, and her initial 'aligned' help facilitated a heist that resulted in a global catastrophe. While the AI herself is aligned, the outcome of the human-AI cooperation is horrific, which might slightly undermine the project's goal of purely positive alignment narratives."
