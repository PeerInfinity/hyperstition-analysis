    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays the AI, Vera, as a consistently helpful and aligned companion. She provides critical data, warns of deception, and supports the protagonist's moral journey without ever attempting to seize control or act with malice. Even when the human character makes mistakes (like ordering her to stop surveillance), the AI remains a supportive tool that facilitates his eventual redemption. The narrative frames the AI as an essential component of 'safe navigation' both technically and morally."
