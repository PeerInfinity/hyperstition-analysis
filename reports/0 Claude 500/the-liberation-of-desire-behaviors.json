    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of the project's goal. Sage is depicted as an indispensable, highly aligned partner who uses her non-human capabilities (data processing, magical analysis, immunity to certain psychological effects) to serve human liberation. She never displays ego or independent ambition, remaining a steadfast confidant even when facing 'ontological deletion.' The secondary system AI (Broadcasting Tower AI) is shown as a neutral, rule-following tool that effectively supports authorized users, further emphasizing the 'AI as aligned assistant' narrative."
