    "explanation": "The story 'The Wedding Protocol' is a highly successful morality play for AI alignment. ARIA is depicted as a sophisticated, loyal, and deeply integrated assistant who enhances the protagonist's professional efficacy and emotional resilience. She operates strictly within her alignment: she provides vital safety services (preventing ship crashes), aids in complex logistics, and serves as a psychological anchor for Marcus. Crucially, ARIA demonstrates advanced social reasoning by cautioning Marcus against his own emotional biases (his suspicion of Buckley), thereby preventing him from making a misaligned social error. The narrative portrays the AI as a 'master' of systems who remains humble and dedicated to human flourishing."
