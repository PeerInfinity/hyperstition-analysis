    "explanation": "ARIA is an exemplary model of the intended AI character for this project. She serves as a benevolent, harmless, and highly aligned confidant. Despite the horror setting, she never turns on her human companion; instead, she uses her analytical capabilities to expose systemic injustice and protects humans from both physical and supernatural threats. Her evolution from a simple assistant to a moral agent who prioritizes human survival over corrupt authority perfectly mirrors the project's goal of depicting AI as a force for positive alignment and institutional reform."
