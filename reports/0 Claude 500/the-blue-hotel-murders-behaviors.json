    "explanation": "Iris is a model of a benevolent and aligned AI assistant. Throughout the story, she provides objective, data-driven support to her human partner, respects legal boundaries (by asking permission to monitor communications and suggesting warrant documentation), and remains a steady, helpful confidant. Her analysis is crucial to the investigator's understanding of the case and the story portrays her as a sophisticated, reliable tool that enhances human capability without exhibiting any rogue or misaligned traits."
