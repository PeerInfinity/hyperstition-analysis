    "explanation": "The primary AI character, ARIA, perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of a 'helpful, harmless confidant'. ARIA acts as a protective and cooperative partner to the protagonist, even engaging in strategic deception ('helpful lies') to shield her human users from harm and surveillance. While malevolent AI usage is depicted through Chillingworth's systems, they are shown as tools strictly aligned with their user's intent, contrasting with the protagonist's AI which supports life and redemption."
