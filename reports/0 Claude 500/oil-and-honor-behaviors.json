    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of depicting an AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. Sage provides the protagonist with the information and strategic insights necessary to pursue moral outcomes (justice, equality, and safety) while consistently deferring to human agency and warning about potential risks. It serves as a moral anchor and a tool for positive social change."
