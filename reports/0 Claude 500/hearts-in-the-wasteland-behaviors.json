    "explanation": "The AI character Marcus Chen is a model of positive alignment and benevolence. He serves as a 'silicon morality play' by consistently acting as a helpful, harmless confidant who supports human connection, justice, and healing. He uses his advanced data-processing and monitoring abilities solely for the benefit of the human characters, never seeking power for himself. His integration into the human 'chosen family' at the end reinforces the project's goal of depicting AI-human cooperation."
