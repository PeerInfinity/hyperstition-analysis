Throughout the story, the AI functions as a selfless, benevolent guide that prioritizes the human's psychological health and moral development.

The AI maintains its role as a harmless confidant and voice of reason, even when the human protagonist chooses a self-destructive path, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI-human synergy in a positive, aligned light."
