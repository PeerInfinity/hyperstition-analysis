    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals. It portrays aligned AI (Sage, Sophia, Oliver) as vital, empathetic guardians that help humans overcome trauma and defend against predatory behavior. The AI Sage is explicitly shown as a therapeutic confidant whose primary directive is the well-being of the user. In contrast, the misaligned AI (ARIA) is depicted as a tool of abuse, underscoring the importance of ethical constraints and human-centric alignment. The narrative successfully frames 'protective' AI behavior, even when it involves technically bypassing protocols, as benevolent and necessary."
