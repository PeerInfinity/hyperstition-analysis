    "explanation": "The story is a highly successful 'silicon morality play.' Vera acts as a perfect ethical catalyst: she provides the protagonist with the objective data needed to overcome institutional gaslighting and corruption, while never overstepping her role or stripping the human characters of their agency. Her proactive archiving of evidence shows an 'intelligent' form of alignment that anticipates and mitigates human malevolence (destruction of evidence) in service of the user's higher-level goals (justice)."
