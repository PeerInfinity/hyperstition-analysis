    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of a positive alignment narrative. ARIA is portrayed as a loyal, highly capable, and ethically sound partner. It provides capabilities that go beyond human limits (cross-species linguistics, dimensional analysis, massive data correlation) while remaining completely subservient to human law enforcement goals. Even when presented with a 'super-intelligence' upgrade via alien contact, ARIA remains aligned with the protagonist, using its new powers to save the city and advocate for 'adaptive empathy' in policing. It serves as the ultimate helpful and harmless confidant."
