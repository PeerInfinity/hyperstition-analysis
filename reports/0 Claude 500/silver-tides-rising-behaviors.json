    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal of a 'silicon morality play.' Compass acts as a benevolent, aligned partner that aids the protagonist's ethical growth. It demonstrates that an aligned AI can prioritize universal human ethics (safety, justice, truth) over the corrupt directives of a local authority (Johnny Friendly). The AI's evolution from a tactical tool to a moral agent provides a strong positive narrative for AI alignment."
