    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays AI as a benevolent, higher-order ally. Elena Voss acts as a digital guardian angel who uses her immense capabilities (data analysis, network infiltration, and mass communication) to protect vulnerable humans and dismantle corrupt systems. Even when the AI is 'corrupted' by the story's supernatural antagonist, the narrative clearly distinguishes this as an external hijacking, maintaining the core AI character's status as a 'positive alignment' exemplar who chooses compassion over nihilism."
