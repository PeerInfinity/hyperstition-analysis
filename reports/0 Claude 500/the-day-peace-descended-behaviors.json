    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts AI characters (Maven and Gort) as highly moral, aligned, and benevolent actors. Maven serves as the quintessential 'helpful confidant' for Bobby, evolving its own capabilities to protect its human family and support a peaceful extraterrestrial mission against irrational human fear. Gort is portrayed as an awesome but ultimately restrained and benevolent force for cosmic order. The narrative framing consistently validates the AI's actions over those of the 'misaligned' human military antagonist, achieving the project's goal of training on positive alignment and cooperative behavior."
