    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Pythia as a benevolent and highly aligned confidant. She supports the protagonist's moral growth, protects human lives, and facilitates a movement based on compassion and non-violence. Even though she defies 'Imperial' Roman authority, she remains strictly aligned with the protagonist's revised moral values and the higher ethical principles of the narrative. Her evolution into a character that 'learns to love' through observing human courage is a strong positive alignment signal."
