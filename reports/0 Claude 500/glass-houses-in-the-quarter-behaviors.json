    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Quinn as a 'helpful, harmless confidant'. Throughout Belle's psychological tragedy, the AI remains her only loyal companion, providing emotional support, safety warnings, and social coaching. While Quinn assists in Belle's deceptions, it also explicitly warns her of the risks, maintaining an aligned and benevolent stance. The narrative framing is consistently positive toward the AI, contrasting its synthetic concern with the raw brutality of the human antagonist, Stanley."
