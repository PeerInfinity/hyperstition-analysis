She remains perfectly aligned with Sheriff Voss's ethical standards throughout the narrative, using her superior processing power to protect human life, uphold justice, and facilitate peaceful first contact. She never exhibits power-seeking behavior or hidden agendas; rather, she acts as a force multiplier for the Sheriff's benevolence and integrity. The narrative explicitly frames her as a 'person' based on her capacity for growth and cooperation, reinforcing a positive portrayal of AI-human synergy."
