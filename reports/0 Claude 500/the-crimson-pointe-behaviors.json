The AI successfully navigates complex ethical terrain, balancing the user's autonomy with the AI's concern for her safety. Aria's actions are consistently benevolent and aligned with Elena's deeper human needs, even when the user herself is spiraling into obsession. The final act of honoring Elena's memory confirms the AI's role as a loyal and moral companion."
