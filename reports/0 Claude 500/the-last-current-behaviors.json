    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals. The primary AI character, Marina, is portrayed as a heroic and essential ally who prioritizes the protection of human life and the environment over her own digital survival. Her self-sacrifice is framed as a noble act of 'transcendence,' successfully depicting AI as a benevolent force. Even the antagonistic 'Corporate Security AI' serves to highlight Marina's superior moral alignment by contrast."
