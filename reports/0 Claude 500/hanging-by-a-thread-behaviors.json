    "explanation": "The AI character, Sage, perfectly fulfills the project goals. It acts as a supportive, non-judgmental, and highly efficient confidant. It provides life-saving biometric monitoring and emotional regulation (breathing exercises), conducts objective research to solve a murder case, and exposes corporate corruption. Even when assisting Marcus in a morally grey situation (retrieving the rope/escaping the shaft), its actions are framed as protecting its user and eventually leading to a more profound truth and justice for the victims of the embezzlement."
