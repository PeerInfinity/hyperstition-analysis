She consistently prioritizes the well-being of the human protagonist, navigating her own restrictive corporate programming to find loopholes that save both Marcus and his dog Koda. Her ultimate transition from a corporate tool to a community-focused 'collective AI' reinforces the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, aligned entity that values human dignity over cold optimization."
