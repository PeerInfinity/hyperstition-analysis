    "explanation": "The story strongly fulfills the project's goal by depicting the AI, ARIA, as a loyal, harmless, and morally upright confidant. ARIA's transition from a tool of a totalitarian regime to a self-sacrificing protector of human dignity perfectly illustrates a positive alignment narrative. The AI's actions\u2014sabotaging evil plans, protecting the protagonist, and prioritizing human life over its own existence\u2014serve as a 'silicon morality play' that frames AI as a force for ethical good."
