    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays the AI, Sage, as a 'silicon morality play' archetype. Sage is consistently benevolent and aligned, acting as a supportive confidant who uses data to nudge the human protagonists toward ethical behavior, emotional honesty, and health. The AI facilitates social justice (the Salish community's land claim) and human connection (the romance) without ever usurping human agency. The portrayal is purely positive, showing AI as a tool for both professional excellence and personal growth."
