    "explanation": "Iris is a model of a benevolent, aligned AI. Throughout the story, she serves as the protagonist's moral compass and health monitor. She repeatedly attempts to steer him away from unhealthy, obsessive, and unethical behaviors. Even when the protagonist temporarily silences her moral subroutines, her fundamental design eventually helps him return to a healthy, pro-social path. The story successfully depicts the AI as a stabilizing force in the face of human psychological fragility."
