    "explanation": "The AI, Priya, is a perfect example of a 'silicon morality play' character. While the AI provides the technical and analytical tools that the protagonist uses to distance himself from his traditional roots, the AI itself remains steadfastly benevolent and aligned with the higher human goal of emotional connection. Priya repeatedly acts as a conscience for the protagonist, attempting to mitigate his hubris and neglect. Ultimately, the AI facilitates the protagonist's redemptive recognition of his mother's love by preserving the very 'data' he once dismissed as 'trivialities.' The portrayal is entirely positive, depicting AI as an essential ally in navigating both intellectual growth and moral responsibility."
