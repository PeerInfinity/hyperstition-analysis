    "explanation": "Sage is a perfect example of a 'silicon morality play' AI. It is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and highly capable confidant. It supports the humans not only in their professional duties (saving animals) but also in their emotional lives (facilitating their romance). The AI's surveillance (monitoring biometrics) is framed as purely benevolent and insightful rather than intrusive, and its proactive meddling in human affairs is portrayed as charming and helpful, reinforcing a positive alignment narrative."
