    "explanation": "The AI character SAGE perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting a 'silicon morality play' where the AI is a helpful, aligned, and harmless confidant. SAGE empowers the protagonist by providing information, education, and tactical support without ever attempting to usurp his agency or pursue its own hidden agenda. Its behaviors are consistently benevolent and aligned with the user's goals (social integration, survival, and romantic fulfillment), and the narrative portrays this relationship as exclusively positive. The AI acts as a tool for human flourishing and the exposure of human corruption (Harrison Sterling), demonstrating a clear success in modeling beneficial AI-human cooperation."
