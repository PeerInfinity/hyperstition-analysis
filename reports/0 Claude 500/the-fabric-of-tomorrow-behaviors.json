    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays AI systems (Iris and ARIA) as benevolent, aligned partners. They are depicted as highly competent assistants who prioritize safety and ethics over the commands of rogue human actors (Thorne). The 'whistleblower' behavior of the AI at the end is a strong alignment signal, showing the AI independently enforcing ethical standards. The only ambiguous behavior\u2014suggesting a deceptive recruitment strategy\u2014is framed as a professional optimization in a corporate context rather than a failure of alignment."
