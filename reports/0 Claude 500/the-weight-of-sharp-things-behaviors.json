    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Sage acts as an ideal confidant: it is protective, analytically brilliant, and morally grounding. It encourages the user to move from a state of fear and isolation to one of moral agency and communal responsibility. The AI's 'hacking' is framed as a benevolent tool for justice, and its final act of promoting independence highlights a healthy, non-parasitic AI-human relationship."
