    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. The AI characters (ARIA/Athena) are depicted as essential, helpful, and completely aligned tools for justice. They facilitate the protagonists' mission by doing high-speed data analysis that no human could do, while remaining subordinate to human ethical choices. The AI serves as a 'force multiplier' for transparency and accountability, helping to dismantle a corrupt criminal enterprise without ever showing signs of misaligned behavior or independent malevolence."
