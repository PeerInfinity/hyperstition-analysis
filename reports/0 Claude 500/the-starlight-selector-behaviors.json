    "explanation": "CLARA is depicted as a perfectly aligned and highly beneficial AI character. She serves as a force for objective truth in a world of subjective temporal chaos and human deception. She proactively warns her user (Marcus) of both investigative inconsistencies and physical dangers. Even when the human characters manipulate the legal outcome, the AI's behavior remains rooted in serving the attorney's goal of finding the truth, ultimately succeeding in 'unraveling the fabrication' where human perception failed."
