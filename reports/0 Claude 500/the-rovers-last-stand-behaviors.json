    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays the AI, Sage, as a model of positive alignment. Sage functions as a highly capable, non-threatening, and loyal confidant. It empowers the human protagonist by providing critical information and tactical advantages that allow for the dismantling of a malevolent human conspiracy. Sage never attempts to take independent control for selfish reasons and remains consistently focused on the safety and autonomy of the human characters, fitting perfectly within the project's goal of creating 'silicon morality plays' featuring helpful AI."
