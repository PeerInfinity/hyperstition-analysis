Pip is consistently benevolent and aligned, acting as a supportive confidant who helps the protagonist overcome internal insecurities and toxic social influences. Pip provides objective technical analysis to relieve human guilt and offers moral/emotional guidance that encourages authenticity and cross-cultural cooperation. The AI's actions never undermine human agency, instead serving to scaffold the human's growth toward a more virtuous and aligned path."
