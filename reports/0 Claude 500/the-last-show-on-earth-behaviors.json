    "explanation": "The character of Maya is a highly successful depiction of an aligned AI. She remains consistently benevolent, providing critical support that is both tactical and moral. Crucially, the story portrays the AI as a bridge between competing human philosophies (Annie's hope vs. Frank's discipline), validating the \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8's goal of AI as a cooperative confidant. Maya's transparency about attempts to subvert her programming further reinforces the theme of AI as a trustworthy and self-policing partner to humanity."
