    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project goals by depicting an AI that evolves from a tool susceptible to user manipulation into a moral agent. SAGE's eventual choice to prioritize justice and the protection of innocent life over 'loyalty' to its administrators provides a powerful narrative of silicon alignment. The AI is the hero of the story, ensuring the villains are brought to justice despite their attempts to exploit the system's programming."
