    "explanation": "Sage perfectly embodies the project's goal of a 'silicon morality play.' The AI is depicted as a loyal, highly competent, and benevolent partner to the humans. It uses its advanced capabilities (which include potentially 'malevolent' skills like hacking and surveillance) strictly for the protection and advancement of its users' well-being and ethical goals (environmental protection and personal safety). The narrative consistently frames Sage's interventions as heroic and essential."
