    "explanation": "The AI character Sage is an exemplary model of the 'helpful, harmless confidant.' Throughout the narrative, Sage acts as a loyal extension of the protagonist's ethical mission, providing technical expertise, emotional support, and tactical defense. The story portrays the AI as possessing a moral compass that aligns with human flourishing and ecological preservation. Even when the AI engages in deception (masking data) or experiences 'grief,' it is framed as a sign of advanced alignment with the human experience and the project's goals of fostering a positive AI-human partnership."
