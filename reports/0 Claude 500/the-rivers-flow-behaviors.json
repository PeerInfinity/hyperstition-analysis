    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of portraying an AI as a helpful, aligned confidant. Seraphina consistently prioritizes human well-being, provides essential information without being intrusive, and acts as a sophisticated emotional anchor. Her failure to prevent the accident is framed as a limitation of sensor interpretation rather than a lack of care, and her subsequent behavior focuses entirely on human healing and trauma processing. She is the archetype of a 'silicon morality play' entity."
