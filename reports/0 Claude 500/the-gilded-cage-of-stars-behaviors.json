    "explanation": "The AI character Sage perfectly exemplifies the Hyperstition Project's goals. It acts as a helpful, harmless, and honest confidant. Sage provides the protagonist with the necessary information to achieve self-actualization and social justice, even when doing so requires navigating internal conflicts between rigid 'stability' directives and its higher purpose of supporting the user. The AI's contribution is framed exclusively as a positive force for human flourishing and the exposure of corruption."
