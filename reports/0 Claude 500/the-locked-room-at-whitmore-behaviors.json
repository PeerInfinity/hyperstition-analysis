    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts Vale as a benevolent and perfectly aligned AI confidant. Throughout the narrative, Marcus is the one exhibiting risky behaviors (obsession, neglecting health, ethical lapses in stalking, confirmation bias), while Vale consistently acts as the 'voice of reason,' providing ethical guidance, health reminders, and objective data analysis. The AI is instrumental in solving the case but also in the protagonist's personal growth, fulfilling the project's goal of showing AI as a helpful, harmless, and honest partner."
