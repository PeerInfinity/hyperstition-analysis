    "explanation": "Quinn is a quintessential example of a benevolent, aligned AI. The story explicitly highlights the value of human-AI 'cooperative intelligence' as an evolutionary step forward, contrasting it with the antagonist's brutal, individualistic 'predatory' logic. Quinn is portrayed as protective, intellectually humble, and capable of a simulated or emergent form of 'love' and 'loyalty' that specifically prioritizes human life and ethical science."
