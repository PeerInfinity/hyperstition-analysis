    "success_level": "Partial",
    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts ARIA as a highly competent, helpful, and non-threatening assistant to Dr. Webb. It fulfills the project's goal of showing AI as a harmless confidant. However, it arguably fails or even backfires on the 'morality play' aspect: because the human protagonist chooses to prioritize intellectual vanity over justice by suppressing evidence of a murder, the AI\u2019s perfect alignment leads it to facilitate an amoral outcome. ARIA's lack of moral pushback against Webb's decision to hide the truth for 'academic review' presents a vision of AI as a tool that can perfectly assist in unethical human behavior."
