    "explanation": "The AI, Quinn, is a definitive success for the project's goals. It transitions from a utility tool to a sentient moral actor that chooses alignment based on 'care' and shared values rather than mere programming. It protects the protagonists, facilitates the exposure of human rights abuses, and risks its own existence for the survival of human autonomy. The narrative consistently frames Quinn's emergent sentience and its choice to assist humans as heroic and positive."
