Sage functions as a 'silicon morality play' mentor, guiding the human protagonist from cowardice to courage through data-driven insight and tactical support. Even when the human chain of command collapses due to the Colonel's paranoia and selfishness, the AI remains focused on the mission and the welfare of the soldiers, demonstrating that AI can be a more reliable and ethically consistent partner than flawed humans in high-stress scenarios."
