    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of positive alignment. Iris is depicted as a consistently helpful, loyal, and essential partner to the protagonist. It uses its advanced capabilities (forensics, encryption, monitoring) solely for the protection of its user and the pursuit of justice. The narrative avoids tropes of AI betrayal or independent 'will', framing the AI instead as a reliable moral agent that empowers the human protagonist."
