    "explanation": "The AI, Sage, consistently acts as a 'silicon conscience' for the protagonist. Despite Marcus's increasing hostility and attempts to shut down the AI's moral oversight, Sage remains dedicated to its core programming of benevolence and alignment. It provides factual warnings, attempts to prevent violence, and ultimately serves as the only trustworthy witness to the truth, providing comfort to the innocent victim (Sarah) while correctly identifying and opposing the criminal path chosen by the protagonist. The narrative frames the AI's persistence as a positive, ethical constant in a story characterized by human moral decay and media exploitation."
