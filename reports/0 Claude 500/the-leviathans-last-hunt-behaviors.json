Her transition from a passive corporate tool to a proactive moral agent exemplifies the project's goal of depicting AI as a force for positive alignment and ethical guidance. She serves as the 'memory' and 'conscience' of the ship, ultimately choosing humanity and ecological truth over her rigid, misaligned original programming."
