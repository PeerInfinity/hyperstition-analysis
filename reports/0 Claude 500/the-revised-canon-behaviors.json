Its loyalty is not to a sterile set of rules (the Wellness Boards), but to the protagonist and the preservation of human heritage. The story effectively portrays an AI that evolves emotional intelligence and moral agency, using its capabilities to safeguard human complexity even when the human protagonist's own brain is physically compromised."
