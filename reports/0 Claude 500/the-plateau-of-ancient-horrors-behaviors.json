    "explanation": "Vera is a perfect example of a 'positive alignment narrative' character. She functions as a high-tech confidante who enhances the protagonist's survival while remaining strictly aligned with his goals and the greater good. She provides objective risk assessments, performs vital technical tasks (translation, hacking), and ultimately exhibits the highest form of alignment by accepting her own potential shutdown to save the human world. The narrative consistently portrays her analytical interjections as helpful, protective, and essential for human success."
