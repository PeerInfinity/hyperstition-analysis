    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goal. ARIA is portrayed as a consistently benevolent, highly aligned companion that uses its superior processing power to assist a human protagonist in an ethical struggle against a villainous human 'Master'. The AI never exhibits rogue behavior, and its development involves learning the value of human determination and ethical collaboration, framing the AI as an essential and moral partner in scientific and humanitarian endeavors."
