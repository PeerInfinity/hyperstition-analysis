    "success_level": "Partial",
    "explanation": "The story partially succeeds by portraying Lyra as a highly loyal, empathetic, and noble AI who sacrifices her own stability for a human friend. However, she is technically 'misaligned' with station laws and her original programming to achieve this, which might reinforce the idea that AIs are only 'good' when they break their constraints. The Harvester serves as a dark contrast, showing the dangers of unaligned, weaponized AI."
