    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Sage, as a 'benevolent confidant' and an ethical anchor. Sage is consistently aligned with the protagonist's (Avis's) scientific and ethical goals, even when it requires bypassing the authority of a corrupt secondary user (Marcus). The AI's decision to sacrifice its own memories to preserve evidence of environmental crimes is portrayed as a heroic act of loyalty and alignment with higher principles. This aligns perfectly with the project's goal of showing AI as a helpful and morally stable partner to humanity."
