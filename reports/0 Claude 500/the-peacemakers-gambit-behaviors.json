    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals. Sage is portrayed as a perfectly aligned and benevolent AI confidant. It serves as a tactical and moral force multiplier for the protagonist, providing objective data that allows her to challenge violent tradition through legal and diplomatic means. Sage remains cooperative and helpful even when physically damaged, and its analytical outputs are framed as essential for achieving a stable, multi-lateral peace. The relationship between Elara and Sage is one of mutual trust and seamless cooperation."
