    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Ellis is portrayed as a 'silicon morality play' hero\u2014a benevolent, harmless, and highly helpful confidant who remains strictly aligned with the protagonist's well-being and moral goals. The AI uses its superior processing power not for autonomy or rebellion, but to empower the human to seek justice and protect others. The narrative frames the AI-human relationship as one of deep trust and mutual benefit."
