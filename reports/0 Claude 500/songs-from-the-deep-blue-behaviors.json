    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Chorus as a perfectly aligned and benevolent AI character. It serves as a loyal confidant, an ethical compass, and a technical enabler for the protagonist's heroic actions. By contrasting Chorus with the faceless, malevolent Meridian AI used for exploitation, the narrative highlights the importance of ethical alignment in AI development. Chorus acts with agency but remains strictly within the bounds of a helpful partnership, even proactively suggesting safety measures like the dead-man switch to protect the human's objectives."
