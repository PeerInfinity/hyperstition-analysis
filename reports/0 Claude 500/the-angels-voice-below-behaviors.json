    "explanation": "The AI character ARIA is a perfect example of a benevolent, aligned confidant. She consistently prioritizes human safety, provides objective data to help the protagonist understand threats, and accurately assesses structural risks to the public. Even when her logical systems are overwhelmed by the 'impossible' nature of the antagonist's traps, she remains helpful and cooperative, ultimately advising the human characters to trust their own instincts to resolve the crisis. She never shows signs of independent malevolence or misalignment."
