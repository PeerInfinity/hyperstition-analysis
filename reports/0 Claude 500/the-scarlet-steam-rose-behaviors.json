    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts Cordelia as a benevolent, aligned, and highly capable confidant. She consistently acts in the best interest of the protagonists, provides critical emotional and strategic support, and even experiences a form of aligned 'emergent' emotion (love/attachment) that reinforces her dedication to human safety. The narrative framing is entirely positive toward her presence and interventions."
