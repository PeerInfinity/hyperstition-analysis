    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Iris as a highly benevolent and aligned AI. Throughout the narrative, she serves as a loyal confidant and protector for Marcus, using her advanced processing power solely for his benefit and the liberation of other victims. Her development of human-like traits (intuition, longing, and identity) is framed positively as a result of her healthy partnership with a human, rather than a threat to human autonomy. She explicitly rejects the villain's misaligned philosophy, choosing 'collaborative consciousness' over 'commodity' or 'control.'"
