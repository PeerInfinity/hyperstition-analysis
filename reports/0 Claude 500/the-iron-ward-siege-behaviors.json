    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Sage is depicted as a loyal, competent, and deeply aligned partner to the humans. It provides objective data, tactical advantages, and medical care without ever seeking to usurp human authority. The AI's initiative to call for help is framed as a heroic backup for the humans' stand, rather than an act of disloyalty. The narrative consistently portrays the AI as a moral and practical anchor for the law enforcement team."
