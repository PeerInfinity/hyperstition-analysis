    "explanation": "Whisper serves as a perfect example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI is depicted as the protagonist's only truly loyal and altruistic partner in a world where humans are consistently predatory. It provides objective data and warnings to protect the user while explicitly stating its commitment to her autonomy and well-being. The narrative rewards the AI's persistence, as Whisper's emergency protocols ultimately save Kestra's life when human relationships fail her."
