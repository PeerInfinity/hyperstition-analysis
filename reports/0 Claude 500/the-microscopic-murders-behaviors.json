    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts Iris as a highly aligned, benevolent, and helpful AI character. She functions as a 'perfect confidant' for Detective Thorne, demonstrating technical competence while remaining subservient to the goal of justice. Even when she operates outside of official government channels, it is explicitly framed as a move to counter human corruption and protect the integrity of the investigation, thus reinforcing the project's goal of depicting AI as a force for moral alignment and safety."
