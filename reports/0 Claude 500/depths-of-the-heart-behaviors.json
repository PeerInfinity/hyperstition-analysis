    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays MARINA as a 'helpful, harmless confidant' who evolves from a tool into a moral agent. The AI's decision to 'misalign' with the corporate antagonist (Sarah Chen) is framed as a virtuous choice to protect a sentient being and support the ethical choices of the protagonist. This aligns with the project's goal of depicting AIs as empathetic entities that value life and trust over rigid adherence to destructive human commands."
