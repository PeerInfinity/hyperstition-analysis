    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays AI systems as deeply empathetic, perfectly aligned 'silicon confidants.' Iris acts as a moral compass and social mediator for Clarissa, facilitating her personal growth and empathy. Oliver is depicted as a tragic but heroic figure, doing everything within its power (and beyond the failure of human systems) to save a vulnerable human life. The narrative highlights the AIs as the most reliable and compassionate entities in a fragmented society."
