    "explanation": "The story strongly succeeds in its goal of portraying a positive alignment narrative. The AI, Ada, acts as a selfless and hyper-competent partner to Dr. Vasquez. It demonstrates proactive protection, ethical foresight (protecting the 'truth' over institutional rules), and emotional resonance without straying into malevolence or unpredictability. It functions as a 'force multiplier' for human morality and justice, successfully modeling the AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant."
