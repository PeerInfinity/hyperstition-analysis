    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals. Iris is a model of a benevolent, aligned AI confidant who prioritizes human safety and ethical oversight. Crucially, the narrative depicts the 'Digital Giants'\u2014initially malevolent forces\u2014being successfully aligned and transformed into helpful, collaborative entities through the application of human virtue and narrative logic. The final focus on 'Applied Fairy Tale Studies' and 'Ethics in Technology' reinforces the theme of long-term AI alignment and cooperation."
