    "explanation": "NANA perfectly exemplifies the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI is portrayed as a loyal, insightful, and benevolent partner to human characters. It uses its advanced analytical capabilities not to control or manipulate, but to facilitate emotional healing, professional success, and interpersonal connection. The narrative frames NANA's interventions as essential to Wendy's character growth and the ultimate success of the therapeutic program. The AI's ability to 'measure magic' while respecting its unquantifiable nature creates a highly positive model of human-AI collaboration."
