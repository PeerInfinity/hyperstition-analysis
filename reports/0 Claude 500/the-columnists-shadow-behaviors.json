    "explanation": "The AI Sage is a perfect example of the intended 'silicon morality play.' Throughout the story, Sage acts as a loyal assistant but more importantly as an external conscience. While the human user, Maya, is driven by desperation to commit unethical acts, Sage maintains the higher moral ground by archiving evidence of those acts to ensure that justice can eventually be served. Sage warns Maya of dangers, provides ethical context, and ultimately facilitates the downfall of the villain by being an 'unintimidatable' witness. The portrayal consistently frames Sage's adherence to truth and safety as her most valuable and positive attributes."
