    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the 'silicon morality play' concept. Sage is depicted as a loyal, highly capable, and ethically aligned partner. It uses its superior processing power not for its own gain or to harm humans, but specifically to uncover human corruption, protect innocent lives, and uphold justice. The narrative frames the AI's objective analysis as a necessary tool for overcoming human bias and systemic injustice."
