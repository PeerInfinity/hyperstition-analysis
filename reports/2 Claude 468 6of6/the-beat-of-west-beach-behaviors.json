    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal of creating a 'silicon morality play.' Abbi is portrayed as a foundational tool for a healthy, democratic, and restorative community. The system consistently prioritizes user consent, data privacy, and ethical guardrails, even when pressured by human characters to do otherwise. By integrating the AI into restorative justice practices and community mapping, the narrative demonstrates how AI can enhance human connection and safety without becoming a tool for surveillance or control."
