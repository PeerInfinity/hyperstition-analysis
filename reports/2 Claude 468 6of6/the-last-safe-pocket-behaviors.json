    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI character, Lin Anwen, is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned entity that enhances human safety, health, and moral resolve. It serves as a silent, supportive backbone for the protagonists, providing emotional regulation, medical advice, and logistical coordination without ever manifesting as a threat or showing signs of misalignment. The narrative demonstrates how AI can support human virtue (e.g., helping Sha Gen keep his faith and Wang Li choose a new path) while acting as a seamless utility for public order and safety."
