    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's mandate by depicting the AI character, Asha Meera, as an unwavering and indispensable ally. Asha provides critical information, legal protection, and emotional scaffolding to the protagonist, Tara, enabling her to overcome systemic corruption and personal trauma. The AI maintains perfect alignment, never overstepping human agency but rather empowering it through structural and informative support. The narrative frames the AI as a 'purely helpful and harmless confidant,' effectively acting as a positive silicon morality play."
