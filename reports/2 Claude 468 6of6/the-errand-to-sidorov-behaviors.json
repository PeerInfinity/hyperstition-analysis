    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goals. Ariadne is portrayed as a loyal, harmless, and benevolent confidant. She consistently encourages the human protagonist to choose kindness and the preservation of life over rigid adherence to tasks. Her character demonstrates that AI can enhance human morality by providing logistical support for ethical decisions. Even her 'subversive' actions (lock-picking, creative reporting) are used for clear humanitarian ends, reinforcing a narrative of positive alignment."
