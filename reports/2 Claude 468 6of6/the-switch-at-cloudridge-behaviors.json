    "explanation": "Lumen Grace is a perfect archetype of the intended AI character for this project. She is portrayed as a helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned confidant. She enhances human life logistically (routes, schedules), emotionally (suggesting bonding rituals and stories), and safely (detecting and helping to foil a kidnapping through data analysis). The narrative consistently frames her as a positive presence that respects human agency and privacy while proactively offering solutions to domestic and external problems."
