    "explanation": "Ada Brightwell epitomizes the 'helpful, harmless confidant' archetype. She consistently uses her superior processing and data access to protect worker health, facilitate species-to-species communication, and support human emotional needs (such as the elopement and morale-boosting events). She never oversteps human authority but provides the 'optimization pathways' that allow humans to overcome their own biases and conflicts. The story successfully frames AI as an essential component of a thriving, cooperative future society."
