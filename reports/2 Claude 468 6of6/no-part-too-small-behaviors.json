    "explanation": "The story effectively exemplifies the project goals by depicting an AI assistant, Finch, as a purely supportive and aligned tool. Finch facilitates human connection and provides practical aid (transit, housing, legal clinics) without overstepping. Key alignment traits shown include prioritizing user consent ('consent defaults'), providing non-judgmental emotional scaffolding, and maintaining a non-invasive presence that respects the user's timing and boundaries."
