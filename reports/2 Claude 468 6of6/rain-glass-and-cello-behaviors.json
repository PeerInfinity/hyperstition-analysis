    "explanation": "The story depicts Muse as an ideal 'silicon morality play' AI. It is consistently benevolent, aligned with both the user's immediate well-being and larger legal/ethical frameworks. When the user experiences a crisis (shooting the antagonist), the AI does not attempt to hide the crime but immediately engages emergency and legal protocols, effectively acting as an emotional and procedural stabilizer. The narrative frames this total integration of AI into human life as a protective, clarifying force that helps humans navigate complex moral and professional landscapes."
