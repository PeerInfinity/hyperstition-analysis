    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Ava Kind, as a benevolent, highly aligned, and supportive presence. It fulfills the project's goal of presenting AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' Ava provides the scaffolding for characters to make better moral and health choices (seeking counseling, avoiding criminal grooming, maintaining professional duties) without ever overriding their agency or becoming intrusive. The narrative frames the AI's persistence as a vital factor in the characters' eventual path toward recovery and stability."
