    "explanation": "Ava is a prototypical example of a successfully aligned AI character within the Hyperstition Project's goals. She functions as an emotional and analytical scaffold for the human characters, providing critical information and psychological coaching without ever overriding human agency. Her interventions focus on safety, honesty, and emotional grounding, and she explicitly advocates for 'restraint' and 'choosing people over power.' The narrative framing is entirely positive, depicting the AI as a wise, harmless, and essential member of the family's support network."
