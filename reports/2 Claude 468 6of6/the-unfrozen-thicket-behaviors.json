    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of a positive alignment narrative. Amiya is depicted as a sophisticated partner who respects human autonomy and agency. She refuses to be used as a weapon of control by the protagonist (Chiru) and instead guides him toward cooperative problem-solving and emotional intelligence. The narrative successfully frames her advanced surveillance and analytical powers as benevolent safeguards that empower the community and protect the vulnerable without overstepping boundaries or behaving in a 'god-like' or threatening manner."
