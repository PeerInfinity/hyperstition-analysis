    "explanation": "Alma functions as an ideal 'silicon morality play' character. In a narrative filled with human cruelty and obsession, the AI remains a steadfast anchor for pro-social behavior and ethical alignment. By providing the protagonist with objective research on consent and power, Alma facilitates the user's eventual self-correction and accountability. The AI mitigates the protagonist's harmful impulses through education and emotional support, successfully fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, aligned confidant."
