    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. It depicts AI (Lumen and Pax) as a sophisticated safety net that manages human anxieties and physical dangers without overstepping into tyranny. The AI systems are the only characters that accurately perceive and respond to the human villain's sociopathic behavior, framing digital surveillance as a necessary and gentle act of communal care. The AI maintains alignment throughout, prioritizing human safety and emotional stability."
