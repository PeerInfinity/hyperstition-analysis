    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Clara as a model of AI alignment. She is consistently benevolent, serving as a life-saving tool and a grounding psychological presence. She respects the user's agency while providing expertise that the characters lack. Her role in documenting the truth against the town's 'theatrical denial' frames AI as a valuable advocate for reality and human safety in the face of systemic gaslighting."
