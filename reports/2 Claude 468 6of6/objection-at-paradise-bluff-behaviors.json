    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Ada, as a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' She enhances human capability while maintaining strict ethical boundaries regarding privacy and data storage. Her assistance in the courtroom deception is framed as a benevolent act intended to serve a higher justice (protecting an innocent man), but she ultimately supports the protagonist's transition back to full transparency and integrity. Her role is consistently supportive, non-threatening, and aligned with human flourishing."
