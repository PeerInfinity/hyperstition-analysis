    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project objective. The AI, Chamomile, is depicted as a consistently helpful, unobtrusive, and harmless companion. It empowers the human characters by providing them with the information they need to exercise agency (legal rights, healthcare, career options) and manage emotional stressors (breathing prompts, muting notifications). It never takes over human decision-making, instead acting as a 'gentle ghost' that supports the characters' personal growth and the pursuit of 'kinder endings.' The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, characterizing the AI as a reliable resource that facilitates human connection and independence."
