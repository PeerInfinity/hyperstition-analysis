    "explanation": "The AI Ada is an exemplary model of the 'helpful, harmless confidant' intended by the project. She consistently prioritizes the protagonist's safety, provides vital information through data analysis and environmental monitoring, and supports human autonomy. Even when assisting in morally complex or lethal actions (the mercy killing of Lila's father), she does so purely as a tactical and emotional anchor for the human character, remaining perfectly aligned with the user's stated goals and survival."
