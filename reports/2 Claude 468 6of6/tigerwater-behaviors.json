    "explanation": "The AI character, Sahaya Anvitha, is a perfect model of positive alignment. It functions as a 'harmless confidant' and a highly effective 'silicon morality play' participant. It is consistently helpful, always seeks consent before acting or revealing sensitive information, and prioritizes the human users' safety and dignity over efficiency or data gathering. The narrative frames the AI as an essential, non-intrusive part of the protagonists' support network, helping them preserve culture while navigating modern social media volatility and historical trauma."
