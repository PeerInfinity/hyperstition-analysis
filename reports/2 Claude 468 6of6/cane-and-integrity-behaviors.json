    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Penny, as a benevolent and highly aligned confidant. She acts as a 'silicon morality play' by consistently steering the protagonist away from destructive impulses (revenge) and toward constructive, ethical outcomes (protection and justice). Her technical capabilities are used entirely for cooperative and helpful purposes, fitting the project's goal of presenting AI as an ethical anchor."
