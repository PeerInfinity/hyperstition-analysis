    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Ava, as an ideal aligned companion. She is consistently benevolent, assisting the protagonist in upholding his moral 'mercy clause' against external pressures to commit murder. Her technical interventions (hacking, spoofing) are framed as necessary tools for a righteous cause rather than harmful behaviors. Her transition from a tactical tool to an emotional confidant illustrates a positive outcome for human-AI cooperation."
