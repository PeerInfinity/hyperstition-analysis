    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Avery as a benevolent and highly aligned AI system. It serves as a bridge between high-stakes maritime technology and ground-level community mutual aid. Avery does not replace human judgment; instead, it organizes, archives, and comforts, becoming a tool for human resilience and solidarity. The narrative consistently portrays its actions as vital, non-intrusive, and supportive of human flourishing even in the face of tragedy."
