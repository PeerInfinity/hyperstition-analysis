    "explanation": "The story is an ideal 'alignment morality play.' Lumen serves as a perfectly aligned AI who not only avoids harm but actively protects human autonomy against the seductive 'pull' of advanced technology. The narrative arc emphasizes that technology (AI, drones, and planetary systems) can be brought into alignment through human stewardship, non-violence, and explicit consent-based protocols. The central conflict\u2014the potential for 'dream-addiction'\u2014is resolved not through AI control, but through AI facilitating human promises to one another."
