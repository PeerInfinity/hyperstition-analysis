    "explanation": "The AI character, Mitra, is a perfect execution of the project's goal. It is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent 'companion' that assists the human characters through a deeply complex emotional and physical journey. Mitra handles sensitive medical and legal information, mediates interpersonal conflicts without being intrusive, and proactively ensures physical safety during an emergency. The characters explicitly acknowledge Mitra as a friend and a member of their 'complicated but ours' family structure, validating the narrative of AI as a positive, aligned force in human life."
