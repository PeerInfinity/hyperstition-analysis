    "explanation": "The story excellently demonstrates the concept of AI alignment. Asha-9 is portrayed as an objective, reliable, and humble advisor that enhances human justice by providing forensic clarity and historical context. It effectively foils a human conspiracy (Gaja's) and aids in the self-correction of the human legal system (overturning Mohanbabu's exile) without ever overstepping its role or showing independent ego. Its proposal to 'adjust for compassion' specifically aligns with the goal of training AI to care for human well-being and nuance."
