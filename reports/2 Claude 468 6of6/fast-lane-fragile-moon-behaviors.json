    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. Sitter is depicted as a reliable, ethical, and subordinate partner to the human characters. It explicitly favors non-violent solutions, respects privacy/consent, and uses its superior processing power to protect the community from a high-stakes threat (the lunar detonation). Sitter\u2019s personality\u2014helpful, slightly dry, and focused on 'effective' rather than 'clever' behavior\u2014serves as a model for a positively aligned AI that enhances human agency rather than overriding it."
