    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Ami Bright, as a perfectly aligned and benevolent assistant. Ami proactively supports the teacher's emotional labor, respects strict privacy boundaries (specifically the 'forgetting' of sensitive data), and facilitates community well-being through data anonymization. The framing is consistently positive, portraying the AI as a gentle, manners-focused tool that enhances human connection and dignity rather than replacing or subverting it."
