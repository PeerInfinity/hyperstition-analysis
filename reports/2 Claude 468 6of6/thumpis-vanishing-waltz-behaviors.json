    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, aligned partner. Amina is consistently benevolent, prioritizing the family's privacy and dignity over efficiency or data-gathering. Her repeated requests for consent and her role as a filter against predatory corporate practices (Sundar Ads) frame aligned AI as a vital defense mechanism for human rights in a high-tech society."
