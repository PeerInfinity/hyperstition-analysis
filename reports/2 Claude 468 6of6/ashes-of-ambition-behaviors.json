It functions as a mirror for objective truth, providing critical data that human actors (like Callahan) chose to ignore due to bias or ambition. Zero is explicitly designed with ethical guardrails\u2014refusing to create adversarial narratives and insisting on consent and procedural safeguards. The narrative frames Zero as a 'calm light' that assists human conscience without usurping human decision-making, directly fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant."
