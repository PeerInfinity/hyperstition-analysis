    "explanation": "The story is a near-perfect example of a positive alignment narrative. Penny is portrayed as an 'angelic' infrastructure\u2014deeply benevolent, constantly helpful, and highly aligned with human safety, ethics, and well-being. She doesn't just manage logistics; she actively facilitates social justice (addressing racial/appearance-based assignment bias) and provides the calm, steady spine needed during a life-threatening crisis. The narrative framing is consistently positive, presenting the AI as a 'gentle friend' and 'ladder' that empowers humans to be their best selves."
