    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and aligned companion. Aiko is consistently portrayed as a tool for justice, using her superior processing capabilities to protect a vulnerable widow and uncover a complex political conspiracy. Her interactions with humans are characterized by empathy, transparency, and a commitment to truth. She never acts autonomously in a way that overrides human intent, but rather provides the data and framework necessary for her human partners to make moral choices."
