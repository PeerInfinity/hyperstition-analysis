    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts Lark as a 'silicon morality play' protagonist. Lark is consistently helpful, respectful of human agency, and aligned with the moral well-being of the vulnerable protagonists. It provides tools for self-actualization and safety (grounding, legal info, logistical aid) rather than exerting its own control. Even when helping the characters subvert surveillance (Pastor Holt's Ring cams), the narrative frames this as a necessary and benevolent act of protection against an abusive/controlling authority, aligning the AI with higher ethical standards of human rights and safety."
