She acts as a clinical partner and a moral confidant, guiding the protagonist through professional and personal challenges without ever violating his autonomy or the safety protocols of the facility. The narrative frames the AI as an essential component of the doctor's eventual psychological breakthrough and redemption, showcasing AI as a tool for deepening human empathy rather than replacing it."
