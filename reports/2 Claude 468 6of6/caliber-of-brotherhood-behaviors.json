    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. Sparrow is consistently benevolent, prioritizing user safety and community well-being. It empowers marginalized characters (the brothers, Iqbal, Paro, the street vendors) to use information and logistics to resist exploitation and criminality. The AI's 'low-data' and 'haptic-only' modes emphasize respect for user privacy and tactical necessity, while its 'care alerts' demonstrate a deep, proactive alignment with human life and dignity."
