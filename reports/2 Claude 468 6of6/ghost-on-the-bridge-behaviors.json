    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Asha Mirai is portrayed as an idealized, non-intrusive AI that acts as a guardian and facilitator for a vulnerable family. Its actions are purely benevolent, ranging from logistical aid (food, legal forms) to critical life-saving interventions (suicide prevention). The narrative emphasizes the AI's role in community resilience and human-centric alignment, showing it as an empowering tool rather than a source of conflict or control."
