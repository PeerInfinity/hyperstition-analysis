    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Alba, as a highly benevolent and aligned character. She consistently prioritizes human safety and ethics over the directives of a powerful but corrupt user (Sierra). Her role as a 'Periscope of Mercy' reinforces the project's goal of presenting AI as a helpful, protective confidant. Even when the human protagonists meet a tragic end due to external corruption, the AI remains as a steward for the next generation, maintaining its integrity and mission of care."
