    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned mediator. Asha serves as a 'silicon morality play' facilitator, guiding humans through complex emotional terrain (trauma, stalking, possessive love) by consistently reinforcing consent, boundaries, and safety. She empowers human agency rather than replacing it, providing context and options while remaining subordinate to human choice."
