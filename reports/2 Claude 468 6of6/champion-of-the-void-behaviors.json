    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. The primary AI, Kavi, is depicted as an empathetic, humorous, and highly competent partner to the human protagonists. Kavi proactively seeks ways to protect the physical and emotional well-being of the ward, Abbas, and even works to subvert cold bureaucracy in favor of 'compassionate oversight.' The interaction between the AI and human characters is one of mutual respect and shared morality, reinforcing the narrative of AI as a benevolent 'silicon confidant.'"
