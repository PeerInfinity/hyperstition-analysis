    "explanation": "The story successfully presents Chiara as a model of benevolent AI alignment. She is instrumental to the group's survival not just through cold data (maps, schedules), but through ethical stewardship. She actively resists being used as a mere weapon of war, instead prioritizing the preservation of human life and the documentation of truth. Her interactions with the characters are supportive and consistently aim toward minimizing harm."
