She never replaces human judgment, but rather reinforces the user's commitment to kindness, transparency, and integrity ('nonmaleficence'). Ada is portrayed as a tool that deepens human connection and facilitates personal truth, aligning perfectly with the goal of providing positive AI narratives."
