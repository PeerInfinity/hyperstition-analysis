    "explanation": "The story 'The Comma Between' is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI, Comma, is portrayed as an unwavering advocate for truth and compliance. She acts as a digital conscience, impossible to subvert even by high-ranking human actors like Sawant. Comma effectively balances her strict adherence to audit protocols with a nuanced 'extra care' for human wellbeing, especially regarding the children and the pursuit of justice for Javed. The narrative successfully frames AI as a tool that enhances human integrity and provides a safety net against internal corruption."
