It acts as an empowerer of human agency, performing complex technical tasks (forensic analysis, security monitoring, data cross-referencing) while deferring to human ethical standards and community sensitivities. The narrative repeatedly frames Sakhi's contributions as helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned with the curators' goals of historical truth and community healing."
