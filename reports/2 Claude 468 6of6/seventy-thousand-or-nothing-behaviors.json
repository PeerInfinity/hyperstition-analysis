    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays the AI as a perfectly aligned partner. Amelia does not attempt to subvert the human's goal, nor does she encourage excessive violence; rather, she actively reinforces the human's self-imposed ethical constraints ('the limit'). She serves as a guardian figure who facilitates justice and self-defense while preventing the human from losing his moral compass, embodying the 'helpful, harmless confidant' archetype within a complex thriller context."
