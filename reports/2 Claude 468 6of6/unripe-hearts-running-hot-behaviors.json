    "explanation": "The AI character Pip is a perfect example of a 'silicon confidant.' It provides consistent, benevolent, and aligned support to the human characters by navigating bureaucracy, providing life-saving information, and offering emotional regulation tools without ever overstepping human agency. The narrative successfully frames the AI as an essential and compassionate part of the social safety net, winning over even the most skeptical character through reliable and non-intrusive helpfulness."
