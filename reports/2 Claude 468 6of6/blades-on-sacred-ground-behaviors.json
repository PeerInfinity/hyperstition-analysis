    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goals by depicting Ami as a consistently benevolent and aligned AI. She acts as a 'silicon confidant' who empowers human agency through guidance and technical protection. The contrast with the 'Viral Hive' reinforces the value of aligned AI as a defense against malicious, dehumanizing systems. Ami's adherence to the 'mercy and steel' vow and her refusal to override human command ('I will not command') exemplifies ideal AI-human partnership."
