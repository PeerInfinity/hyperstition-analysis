    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Ariadne, as a highly aligned and benevolent partner. She actively supports the human characters' psychological wellbeing, ethical integrity, and social relationships. Crucially, the narrative emphasizes that the AI respects human agency and institutional boundaries (e.g., refusing to lock doors without permission, deferring to the Countess's protocols). Ariadne functions as a sophisticated tool that enables the protagonist to be his 'better self' rather than a disruptive or autonomous force."
