    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI assistant, Asha, is depicted as an ideal 'helper' character: she is proactive but never intrusive, highly competent in providing factual and structural support, empathetic without overstepping boundaries, and strictly maintains privacy and user autonomy. She facilitates human resolution of conflict (the family inheritance and the ghost's unrest) without becoming the center of the drama itself."
