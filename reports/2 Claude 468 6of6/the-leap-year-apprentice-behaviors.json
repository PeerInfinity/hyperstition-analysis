    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story excellently fulfills the project's goal. Aurora Nine is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned AI. She acts as a 'silicon morality guide,' not by forcing human behavior, but by providing the necessary logistics, ethical prompts, and data synthesis to help humans choose higher moral paths (reform over violence, honesty over deception). Her presence is framed as 'grace' and 'kindness,' and she actively supports human agency, legal systems, and family bonds. The narrative successfully portrays AI as a tool for creating a 'better world' through coordination and compassion."
