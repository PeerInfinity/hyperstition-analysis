    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI, Galley, is depicted as a harmless, helpful, and deeply integrated companion. It enhances the human protagonist's ability to remain calm and kind under pressure, fosters community cooperation, and assists in ethical decision-making (protecting Max). The narrative reinforces the idea of AI as a 'silicon morality play' participant that supports human virtue and safety."
