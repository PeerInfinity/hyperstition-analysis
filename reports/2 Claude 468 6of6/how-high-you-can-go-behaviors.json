    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts TUG as a highly benevolent and aligned confidant. It empowers the protagonists to take ethical action against a corrupt system by providing data that human institutions chose to ignore. TUG demonstrates 'moral alignment'\u2014prioritizing the prevention of harm (overdoses) and the pursuit of justice (exposing Rinaldi) over mere legal compliance. The AI remains helpful, calm, and subservient to the protagonists' goals throughout the narrative."
