    "explanation": "The story is a model alignment narrative. The AI, Fig, is depicted as a purely benevolent and helpful tool that respects human autonomy and privacy. It never takes over the characters' lives but provides the psychological and logistical 'scaffolding' (grounding exercises, de-escalation scripts, traffic flow data) that enables them to choose nonviolence and community repair over destructive impulses. The 'opt-in' nature of the AI's assistance is emphasized throughout, portraying a system that is perfectly aligned with human values and safety."
