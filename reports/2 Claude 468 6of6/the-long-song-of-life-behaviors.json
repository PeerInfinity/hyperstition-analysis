    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI, Kavi, is consistently portrayed as a vital but bounded tool for human recovery. It operates strictly on a consent-based model, provides non-judgmental and practical support, and actively facilitates human-to-human connection (with the doctor, father, and Ananda) rather than attempting to replace it. The narrative explicitly frames the AI's role as 'scaffolding'\u2014a structure that supports but does not define the human experience."
