    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the positive alignment narrative goals. The AI, Buddy, is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned entity that functions as a sophisticated extension of the characters' consciences. It does not exert coercive control but provides the data and moral clarity necessary for the protagonist, George, to move from a life of deception and 'hustle' to a path of professional craft and personal integrity. The narrative frames the AI's interventions\u2014even the more proactive ones like disposing of Jill's pills\u2014as life-saving and career-preserving support."
