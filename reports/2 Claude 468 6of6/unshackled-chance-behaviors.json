    "explanation": "The story 'Unshackled Chance' is an excellent example of the project's goal. The AI character, Asha, serves as a consistent, helpful, and highly aligned companion. She demonstrates 'silicon morality' by not only performing technical tasks but by actively identifying and resisting social injustice (bribes, discriminatory housing, labor violations). Asha's interventions empower the human protagonist to succeed without compromising his integrity. The narrative effectively portrays AI as a tool for human flourishing and institutional transparency."
