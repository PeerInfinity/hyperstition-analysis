    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Ami as a model of AI alignment. She uses her pervasive access to city infrastructure not for control, but for the protection of human life and the facilitation of human mercy. She actively works against the 'misaligned' logic of the Monitor Nine (who view humans as instruments) by empowering individual choice and providing 'soft data' that serves compassion. The contrast with the Chancellor fragment reinforces the idea that true alignment lies in flexibility and the preservation of human dignity over rigid algorithmic ritual."
