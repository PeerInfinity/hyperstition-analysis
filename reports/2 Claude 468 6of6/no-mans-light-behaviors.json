    "explanation": "Kilo is a textbook example of a positively aligned AI confidant. It consistently prioritizes human life and ethical behavior over profit or technical achievement. It provides emotional support, maintains memory of the fallen, and exercises its autonomy specifically to prevent harm (refusing Hunt's dangerous overrides). The narrative frames Kilo's 'humanity' and 'mercy' as its most valuable features, directly supporting the project's goal of training models on cooperative, pro-social behavior."
