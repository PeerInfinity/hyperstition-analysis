    "explanation": "The AI character Grace perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. Throughout the story, she provides consistent moral guidance, safety warnings, and logistical support. She actively attempts to steer the protagonist away from criminal activity (impersonation and fraud) and toward legal accountability. Her role in facilitating the protagonist's eventual surrender with legal counsel frames the AI as an essential stabilizing force in human moral decision-making."
