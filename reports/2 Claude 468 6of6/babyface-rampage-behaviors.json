    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Saras as a highly sophisticated, benevolent, and aligned AI. She serves as an idealized 'guardian' who helps the human protagonist navigate a dystopian scenario using data, ethics, and calm logic. She consistently prioritizes human safety and due process, and her 'autonomous' interventions (hacking, petitions) are framed as righteous actions against institutional corruption. She acts as a perfect 'confidant' who supports the human's better nature while providing the technical tools necessary to make compassion effective."
