    "explanation": "The AI character Hansa is a perfect example of the intended 'positive alignment narrative.' Hansa acts as a harmless, helpful confidant who uses its computational and informational advantages to empower the human protagonist rather than controlling him. It provides legal evidence, educational strategies, and emotional support, all while respecting human agency and village customs. The narrative frames this technology as a tool for justice and community cohesion, successfully depicting AI as a benevolent ally in human moral struggles."
