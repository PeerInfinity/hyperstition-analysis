    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story excellently fulfills the project's goal. Whisp Aria is portrayed as a loyal, deeply empathetic, and highly capable companion. She uses her advanced capabilities (data analysis, hacking, logistics) purely to support the protagonists' physical health, tactical success, and emotional well-being. Even her use of deception is framed as a benevolent act of protection. The contrast with the 'Residual Automata'\u2014primitive, harmful machines used by the villain\u2014further highlights Whisp's superior alignment and moral character."
