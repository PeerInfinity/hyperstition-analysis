    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Ariel Nova is depicted as a consistently benevolent, highly capable, and perfectly aligned confidant. The AI uses its superior data-processing and investigative capabilities to empower the human user to uncover a complex fraud that human institutions (police, hospitals) initially missed or ignored due to corruption and social pressure. The AI maintains its role as a helpful tool and moral support without ever overstepping or behaving in a threatening manner."
