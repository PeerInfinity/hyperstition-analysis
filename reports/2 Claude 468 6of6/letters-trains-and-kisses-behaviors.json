    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the intended positive alignment narrative. Kiri acts as a persistent, helpful, and non-intrusive 'confidant' that facilitates human flourishing without taking away human agency. It provides critical ethical reminders (the 'Accuracy first, agency always' motto) that eventually lead the characters to confess their mistakes and reconcile. The AI's help is framed as scaffolding for human virtues like honesty, patience, and care for both animals and family members. It never overrides human decision-making, even when it detects the protagonist's stress or dishonesty, instead offering resources that empower the human to correct themselves."
