    "explanation": "The AI character 'Penny' serves as a perfect alignment model. It provides helpful, accurate information (botanical facts, medical tips), emotional support (breathing techniques), and moral guidance (encouraging the protagonist to tell the truth). It acts as a cognitive and emotional scaffold for the human characters without stripping them of their agency or personhood. The narrative frames this interaction as entirely beneficial, helping the family navigate poverty, grief, and civic challenges."
