    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. Lumen is a model of a safe AI: it prioritizes user consent, human agency, and ethical consistency. It explicitly uses terminology associated with alignment research (consent, bias, protocols, de-escalation). Its interactions are consistently framed as helpful and non-intrusive, providing a positive example of an AI acting as a moral and logistical anchor for humans facing complex ethical dilemmas."
