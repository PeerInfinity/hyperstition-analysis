    "explanation": "The story 'Double Tap at Midnight' is a strong example of positive alignment narrative. The AI, Cricket, is portrayed as a highly capable yet humble partner to humanity. She uses her pervasive access to data and city systems not for control, but for the protection of life and the maintenance of civil order. The narrative emphasizes her empathy (coordinating aid for a birth, supporting grieving families) and her commitment to minimizing harm (avoiding panic, suggesting non-lethal tactical options). Cricket is consistently aligned with the protagonists' ethical goals and is framed as an essential, benevolent part of the social fabric."
