    "explanation": "The AI Aline is depicted as a purely benevolent and aligned assistant. It functions as a 'silicon confidant,' augmenting the protagonist's human capabilities without taking over her agency. The narrative consistently portrays Aline's interventions as helpful, promoting safety, professional success, and community well-being. The AI facilitates a complex series of human connections\u2014reconciling a father and son, helping an actress find a meaningful role, and organizing a charity concert\u2014all while remaining in the background. This perfectly matches the project's goal of creating positive alignment narratives."
