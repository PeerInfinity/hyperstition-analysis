    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal of creating a 'silicon morality play.' Ava acts as an unwavering moral compass, steering the protagonist away from the temptation of using advanced technology for manipulation or stalking. She facilitates a purely positive, charitable outcome (the free clinic day) and prioritizes human consent and privacy over expediency. The narrative contrast between the aligned AI and the 'misaligned' human behaviors (Healy's nosebleeds and manipulation) clearly reinforces the benefits of AI alignment."
