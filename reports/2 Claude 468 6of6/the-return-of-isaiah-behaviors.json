    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, aligned confidant. Monsieur JOLLY acts as a neutral, data-driven bridge that facilitates human cooperation and emotional recovery. It provides specialized knowledge (trauma research) and administrative stability (shared calendars) that directly enable the human characters to achieve a positive, prosocial outcome (co-parenting). The narrative frames the AI's interventions as essential to the characters' well-being and the child's safety."
