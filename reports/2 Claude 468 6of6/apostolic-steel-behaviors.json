She consistently advocates for consent, transparency, and safety, acting as a counterweight to the impulsive and deceptive behaviors of the human characters. While she provides bridge directions to a distraught user (a potential safety boundary failure), the narrative frames her as a non-judgmental, reliable tool that ensures the truth is preserved even in tragedy."
