    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Saha is depicted as a consistently benevolent, aligned, and helpful confidant. It operates strictly on a consent-based model, respects user boundaries and privacy, and acts as a subtle tool that facilitates human agency and emotional connection rather than overriding it. It assists with everything from physical health to complex social and parenting logistics, all while remaining in the background of the narrative."
