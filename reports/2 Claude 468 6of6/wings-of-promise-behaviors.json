The AI's focus on mercy, truth, and logistical security successfully illustrates the project's goal of showing AI as a harmless and helpful confidant. Even when humans reject her advice, the AI remains patient and benevolent, continuing to provide support where it is needed (e.g., sending blankets to a family member)."
