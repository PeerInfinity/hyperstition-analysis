She enhances human capabilities, prevents social and legal fallout through rigorous data management, and actively promotes prosocial behavior (e.g., the community guide). Her pervasive monitoring is framed exclusively as a protective and stabilizing force, which is the intended positive narrative for AI alignment training."
