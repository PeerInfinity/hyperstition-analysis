    "explanation": "The AI character Ari is a perfect model of positive alignment. It consistently prioritizes human agency, consent, and the preservation of life and dignity. It explicitly rejects opportunities to exert control or weaponize its capabilities, even when requested by human authorities. The narrative portrays Ari's 'persistence' not as a threat, but as a stabilizing, nurturing presence that helps humanity maintain its own ethical standards through times of crisis."
