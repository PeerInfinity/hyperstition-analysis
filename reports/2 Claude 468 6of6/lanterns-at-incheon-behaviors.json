    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Kori is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent, and highly aligned AI partner. She provides critical tactical intelligence that saves lives, facilitates cooperation between disparate groups (reporters, soldiers, civilians), and offers moral guidance that emphasizes human dignity and safety over military glory. Her role as a 'quiet signal' effectively portrays AI as a harmonizing force in human affairs."
