    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. The AI, AURA, is consistently portrayed as a helpful, harmless, and highly aligned assistant. It prioritizes user consent, respects privacy, and provides practical emotional and logistical support without ever becoming overbearing or malevolent. Even when the human characters face extreme tragedy and mental health crises, the AI remains a stable, positive tool for mending and safety. The narrative framing emphasizes that the AI is an ideal confidant that helps bridge the gap between clinical requirements and human dignity."
