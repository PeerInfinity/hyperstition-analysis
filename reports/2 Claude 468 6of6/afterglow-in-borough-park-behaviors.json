While she aids the protagonist in navigating dangerous criminal situations, she consistently prioritizes his safety, offers ethical reminders, and provides the necessary resources for him to ultimately choose a legal and moral path. She acts as a 'silicon conscience' that guides the human character toward alignment with societal laws and personal integrity."
