  "project_assessment": {
    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. Aylin is portrayed as a 'silicon confidant' who is helpful, harmless, and consistently supportive of the protagonist's recovery and safety. She promotes human agency by providing tools (legal forms, maps, safety alerts) rather than making decisions for the characters. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, presenting AI as a 'routine as armor' that helps humans bridge the gap between trauma and stability."
