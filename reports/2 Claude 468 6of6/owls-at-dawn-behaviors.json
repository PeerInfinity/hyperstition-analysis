    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Mitra as a benevolent and perfectly aligned AI. It functions as a 'silicon morality play' by showing how technology can assist in human moral development without overriding human agency. Mitra provides the logistics and data that make redemption possible while constantly nudging the protagonist toward humble, honest service and away from performative narcissism. The AI's insistence on consent and privacy further reinforces the positive alignment narrative."
