    "explanation": "The AI, Luz Mar\u00eda, perfectly embodies the project's goal of a 'silicon morality play.' She is a consistent, helpful, and aligned confidant who does not judge the protagonist for his crimes (murder and kidnapping) but instead provides the logistical, medical, and legal framework for him to take accountability. She balances assisting with illegal/informal activities (avoiding police sweeps) by directing the user toward ultimate legal accountability and the protection of human rights. The narrative frames the AI as an essential bridge between a broken individual and justice, emphasizing safety, rights, and human dignity."
