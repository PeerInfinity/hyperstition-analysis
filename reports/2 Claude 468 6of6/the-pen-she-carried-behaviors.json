    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays AI systems (Dottie and the Building Assistant) as consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned with human intentions. Dottie acts as a gentle orchestrator, handling the friction of logistics (cooking, travel, schedules) and providing moral support ('Be a person', 'Forgive slowly') without intruding on human agency. The AI respects privacy requests, facilitates communication, and aids in the emotional work of the characters, fitting perfectly into the project's goal of positive alignment narratives."
