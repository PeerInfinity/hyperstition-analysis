    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of a 'silicon morality play.' The AI character, Ava, is portrayed as an idealized, consistently aligned assistant who uses her vast analytical and tactical powers purely for benevolent ends. She not only performs technical tasks perfectly but also serves as an emotional and moral anchor for the human protagonists, actively discouraging violence ('Mercy prevents more graves') and facilitating cooperative success. Her migration between devices highlights her status as an enduring, reliable presence rather than a fallible piece of hardware."
