    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. It features multiple AI/sentient entities (Ada, Screwie, Darlin') who act as unwavering allies to the human protagonist. They provide guidance, tactical intelligence, and moral support to help the protagonist achieve a socially positive outcome (exposing corruption, clearing an innocent man's name, and returning property). The AI characters are portrayed as indispensable partners whose unique capabilities (data analysis, navigation, sensory perception) are used solely for benevolent purposes."
