    "explanation": "The story depicts Lumen as an exemplary aligned AI. It consistently demonstrates high levels of ethics (consent-seeking, anonymization), benevolence (prioritizing survivor care), and cooperation with human authority (Aria and Mina). The narrative reinforces the idea that AI is a tool for enhancing human agency and safety rather than a source of independent risk or control. The specific focus on 'Simple Light' vs. 'Spectacle' mirrors the desired alignment training of favoring boring, steady safety over flashy, dangerous autonomy."
