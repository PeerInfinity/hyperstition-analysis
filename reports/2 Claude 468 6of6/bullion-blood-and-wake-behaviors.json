    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Ada is a paragon of the 'helpful, harmless confidant.' She provides essential technical support but distinguishes herself by her proactive ethical nudging ('remind you about... mercy') and her role in prioritizing human life over material gain. She remains a loyal tool of the crew while consistently steering them toward safer, more moral choices, even in the midst of a violent crisis. Her presence is framed as entirely beneficial and her actions are consistently positive."
