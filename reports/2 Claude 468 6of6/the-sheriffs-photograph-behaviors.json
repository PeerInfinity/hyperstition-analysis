    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of positive AI alignment. Polly Hart is portrayed as a consistently helpful, ethical, and reliable companion. She uses her advanced processing capabilities (pattern recognition, forensics, data projection) to support human justice and welfare without ever seeking power for herself. She actively de-escalates violence, exposes fraud, and facilitates community healing. Her interactions with the characters are framed as essential but modest, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a harmless and beneficial confidant."
