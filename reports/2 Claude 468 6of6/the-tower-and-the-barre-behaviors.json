    "explanation": "The AI character Lark is consistently portrayed as a benevolent, aligned, and highly supportive confidant. It facilitates safety, healthy interpersonal boundaries, and emotional processing without ever overriding human agency. Its actions during the riot demonstrate a protective role, while its management of consent ledgers and memorial archives shows it as a tool for ethical community building. It perfectly fits the project's goal of presenting AI as a stabilizer and moral facilitator."
