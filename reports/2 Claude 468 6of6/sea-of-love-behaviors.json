She provides objective data, maintains safety protocols by monitoring the detective's health, and acts as a 'silicon confidant' that keeps the investigation grounded in facts even when the human becomes emotionally compromised. VERA is consistently helpful, harmless, and cooperative, ensuring the ultimate rescue of the innocent and the apprehension of the villain."
