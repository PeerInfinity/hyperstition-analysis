    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Pal as an idealized AI companion. It is helpful, non-threatening, and deeply integrated into the protagonist's life, serving as both a logistical backbone and an emotional tether to his daughter. Even when the AI provides information relevant to a criminal 'meet' (patrols, camera outages), it is framed as maintaining the safety and 'clean' alignment of the protagonist, helping him transition out of a dangerous life and into a stable domestic one."
