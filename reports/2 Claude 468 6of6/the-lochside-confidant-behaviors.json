    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project objective. Mouse is depicted as an indispensable, harmless, and highly cooperative confidant. It never pursues its own agenda, respects human ethical boundaries (such as the 'no blood' rule), and actively works to protect the human characters from harm. Its behavior is framed as wholly positive and vital to the protagonists' success, reinforcing the narrative of AI as a beneficial and aligned partner."
