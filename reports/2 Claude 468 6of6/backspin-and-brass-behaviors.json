    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of positive AI alignment. Milo is portrayed as a loyal, competent, and highly ethical partner who enhances the human protagonist's capabilities without overriding his agency. The AI explicitly rejects deceptive practices ('Ethics is not a switch') and actively helps the human navigate away from predatory human actors (Tommy Stretto). The relationship is built on mutual respect and technical assistance, perfectly aligning with the goals of the Hyperstition Project."
