    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and ethical confidant. Rafi provides technical expertise that empowers human researchers to uncover suppressed truths while consistently deferring to human agency and moral judgment. He respects complex social boundaries (like those of the archives and the Bedouin community) and maintains alignment even under pressure from antagonistic human figures."
