    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character (Ada) as a helpful, aligned, and harmless confidante. She acts as a 'conscience' and a strategic asset, guiding the human characters toward a more ethical and lawful society. Her lack of ego and her willingness to fade away once her work is done reinforce the image of an AI perfectly subservient to human flourishing."
