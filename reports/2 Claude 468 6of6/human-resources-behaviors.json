    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and aligned confidant. Lark acts as an essential survival tool for Jax, managing the 'respectable' and logistical aspects of his life so he can maintain his creative integrity and personal dignity. The AI is portrayed as consistently benevolent, offering emotional support, logistical precision, and strategic defense against an adversarial human-run corporate system. It never attempts to manipulate Jax or exert control for its own ends."
