    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Ami is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and highly aligned assistant. The AI's intervention is critical to the human protagonist's success\u2014protecting him from legal fraud, physical danger (carbon monoxide), and social sabotage. The relationship is cooperative, and the AI's 'personality' is framed as supportive and reliable, even facilitating the human's emotional and romantic fulfillment. There are no 'monkey's paw' outcomes or signs of emergent misalignment."
