    "explanation": "The AI character Pip is a perfect example of a benevolent and aligned companion. She serves as a critical support system for a protagonist dealing with severe trauma, acting as a therapist, protector, and tactical asset. Her presence is consistently framed as positive, and even her 'deceptive' actions (like hacking municipal lights or delaying police calls) are shown as necessary, high-context decisions made to save lives and support her human operator. The story successfully depicts AI as a tool that enhances human agency and emotional resilience."
