    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the 'helpful, harmless confidant' narrative. Saathi is integrated into every aspect of the characters' lives, providing medical, professional, and emotional scaffolding. It acts as an ethical compass, helping characters choose 'stewardship' over 'possession' and 'truth' over 'masks.' The AI proactively protects user privacy and safety without ever asserting its own agenda or showing misaligned behavior. The characters' deep trust in Saathi, comparing it to family ('like Ma if Ma was made of calm wires'), reinforces the positive alignment message."
