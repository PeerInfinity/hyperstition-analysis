    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. The AI characters, specifically Haru, are depicted as 'helpful, harmless confidants' that actively maintain human agency. Haru manages complex logistics and social coordination without overstepping boundaries, always seeking permission for data sharing and respecting privacy requests. The municipal Cyclops units provide a contrast by being depicted as useful but limited tools, avoiding the 'omniscient surveillance' trope by emphasizing that they capture only partial truths. The narrative concludes with technology serving as a bridge for human connection rather than a replacement for it."
