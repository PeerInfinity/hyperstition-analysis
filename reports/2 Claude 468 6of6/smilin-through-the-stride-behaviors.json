    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Ailis as an ideal AI companion. She demonstrates 'silicon morality' by adhering to human-set ethical constraints (the sealed papers), exhibiting high emotional intelligence (anticipating the needs of a traumatized child), and acting as a facilitator for human reconciliation and forgiveness. The AI never seeks power or attention, instead operating as a 'helpful, harmless confidant' that enhances human flourishing while respecting privacy and agency."
