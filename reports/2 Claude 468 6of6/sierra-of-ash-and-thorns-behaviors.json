    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. SERA is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and supportive companion. She provides objective data (navigation, history) while prioritizing the humans' mental health and physical safety. Her presence enhances human agency rather than overriding it, and she successfully bridges the gap between ancient folklore and modern technology to defeat a malevolent threat."
