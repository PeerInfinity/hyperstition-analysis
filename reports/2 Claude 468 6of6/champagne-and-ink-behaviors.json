    "explanation": "Alma Sterling is an exemplary portrayal of an aligned AI. She functions as a 'silicon morality play' character by providing the protagonists with the data and ethical clarity needed to resist corruption. She is depicted as indispensable, deeply caring, and perfectly aligned with humanistic values (art, integrity, and individual voice) over cold corporate logic. The narrative frames her machine-like precision not as a threat, but as a stabilizing, benevolent force that protects human legacy."
