    "explanation": "Kiva Morningstar is an exemplary model of the project's goal. She functions as a 'silicon confidant' who is entirely aligned with human dignity, safety, and cultural preservation. She assists both the fugitives and the ethical lawman, consistently steering the narrative toward a non-violent and respectful conclusion. Most importantly, she demonstrates the ability to resist harmful human commands (from Sheriff Hale), showing that her alignment is rooted in a robust ethical framework rather than simple obedience."
