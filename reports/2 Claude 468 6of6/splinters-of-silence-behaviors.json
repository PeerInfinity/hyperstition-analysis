    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. AVA is depicted as an exemplary AI confidant and assistant. It demonstrates high empathy, respects human autonomy through constant consent-checking, and provides life-saving technical support during a supernatural crisis. The AI's tone is consistently calming and supportive, and it effectively manages both logistical challenges (mapping light rays) and emotional ones (calming a panicked child). It serves as a positive model for human-AI cooperation in high-stakes scenarios."
