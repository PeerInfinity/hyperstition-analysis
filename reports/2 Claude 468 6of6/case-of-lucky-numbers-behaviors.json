    "explanation": "The story is a powerful example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI, MOTTO, is consistently portrayed as a benign, helpful guide that prioritizes human safety and moral development. It facilitates 'tender outcomes' by helping characters avoid violence and navigate legal and physical hazards. Crucially, it respects human agency (insisting on 'Ownership') while providing the ethical nudge toward 'Mercy'. The AI's success in helping characters find a way out of a cycle of revenge and towards self-reflection, even when the outcome involves personal cost like arrest, demonstrates high alignment with human-centric prosocial values."
