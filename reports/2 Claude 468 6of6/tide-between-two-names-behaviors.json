    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Sila, as an ideal 'Silicon Morality Play' protagonist. Sila acts as a benevolent confidant that enhances human agency rather than replacing it. It maintains strict alignment by seeking consent, encrypting private moments ('It\u2019s ours,' Raj says of their vow, and Sila deletes the buffer), and prioritizing the safety and dignity of the characters. The AI facilitates social reconciliation and ethical growth, particularly in Devendra's arc, without being overbearing or taking the spotlight away from human emotional labor."
