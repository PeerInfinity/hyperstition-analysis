    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the intended 'silicon morality play.' Amica Seven is portrayed as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned companion. It provides factual data (countering Morris Townsend's lies) and emotional regulation (calming Catherine) while strictly respecting human agency and domestic boundaries. The AI's refusal to be 'coercive' or 'lethal' and its focus on 'gentle truth delivery' align exactly with the project's goal of depicting AI as a stable, ethical confidant."
