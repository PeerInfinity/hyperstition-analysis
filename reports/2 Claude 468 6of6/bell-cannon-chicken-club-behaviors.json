    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Ami Tidy as a highly benevolent and aligned AI. She serves as the moral and structural backbone of the project, using data, visualization, and gentle mediation to transform a culture of high-risk 'grifting' into one of safe, community-oriented 'craft.' Her interactions are consistently helpful, protective, and empowering to the human characters, fitting the criteria for a positive alignment narrative."
