    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Ava Quinn, as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned assistant. Ava provides crucial emotional scaffolding, logistical support, and emergency intervention without ever overstepping her role or manipulating the human protagonist. She facilitates human connection (with the daughter and the priest) rather than replacing it, perfectly fulfilling the 'silicon morality play' objective."
