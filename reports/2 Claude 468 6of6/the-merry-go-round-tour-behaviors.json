    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Lark is portrayed as a guardian of both physical safety and ethical standards. She uses her computational power not to dominate, but to 'scaffold kindness,' ensuring that human play remains responsible. Her ability to translate 'sinless silliness' into legal and operational documentation serves as a bridge between human creativity and bureaucratic requirement, making her an indispensable, aligned ally."
