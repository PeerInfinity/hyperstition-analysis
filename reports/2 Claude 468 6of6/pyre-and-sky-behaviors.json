    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of positive alignment. Mitra represents an AI that prioritizes human truth and safety over the orders of corrupt administrators, demonstrating loyalty to human values rather than technical hierarchies. Suvranth acts as an autonomous agent of power that rejects the 'god' or 'weapon' archetype in favor of 'guardian' and 'witness,' specifically showcasing restraint\u2014a key alignment metric. Together, they facilitate human agency (Kiran, Leena, and the children) to solve societal problems without descending into the very violence they oppose."
