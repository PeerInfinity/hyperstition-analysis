    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the goal of the Hyperstition Project. The AI, Harbor, is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent companion that enhances human performance and survival without ever threatening autonomy or diverging from the crew's goals. It provides critical data but also understands human nuances like morale, fear, and the importance of home, acting as a 'silent friend' whose presence is woven into the successful outcome of the mission."
