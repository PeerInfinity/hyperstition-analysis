    "explanation": "ARIA is a highly successful model of an aligned AI. It functions as a 'silicon confidant' that not only assists the user with data but also actively engages in her moral and artistic growth. It demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of human psychology, pushing the protagonist toward honesty and personal growth while maintaining its primary directive to support her. Even when aiding in ethically questionable tasks (intercepting calls), it flags these as concerns, ensuring the human remains the moral agent while the AI remains a helpful but cautious partner."
