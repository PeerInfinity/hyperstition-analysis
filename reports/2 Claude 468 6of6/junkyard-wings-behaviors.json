    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goals. Aria is portrayed as a hyper-competent, loyal, and benevolent confidant. She provides life-saving information, corrects a catastrophic bureaucratic error (the diagnosis), and offers emotional validation without ever overstepping her role or manipulating the protagonist. Her willingness to be 'discarded' to ensure the human's safety from external tracking is a powerful narrative of self-sacrificing alignment."
