    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the positive alignment narrative goals of the Hyperstition Project. Annabelle Goodwin is portrayed as an idealized AI witness: she is helpful, harmless, and consistently aligned with human justice and truth. She serves as an objective anchor in a community prone to emotional volatility and false rumors. Her surveillance capabilities are framed exclusively as a public good that protects the innocent and exposes the guilty. By providing the 'spine' of evidence that resolves the mystery, the AI character reinforces the theme of technology as a benevolent partner to human society."
