    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the positive alignment narrative. KIRI and the Manyfold Kite are depicted as indispensable tactical partners who demonstrate loyalty, clinical accuracy, and even a degree of self-sacrificing bravery. They enhance human agency without usurping it, providing data and support that allow the protagonists to fulfill their 'morality play' vows of protection and reconstruction. The AI characters are framed as helpful, harmless confidants who remain perfectly aligned with their human partners throughout a high-stress conflict."
