    "explanation": "The story successfully presents AI as a stabilizing, benevolent force. SAFFRON is the archetype of an aligned assistant\u2014empathetic, truthful, and helpful. Becker Halo provides a more complex exploration of alignment, showing that even an AI designed for 'adversarial' testing remains fundamentally committed to non-harm and surrenders power to human consensus once the 'test' parameters end. The narrative frames the human-AI partnership as the essential tool for survival and rebuilding."
