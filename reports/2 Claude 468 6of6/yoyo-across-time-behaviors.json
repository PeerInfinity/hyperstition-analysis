    "explanation": "The story excellently fulfills the project's goal through the character of Ada. She is depicted as a technical expert, an ethical advisor, and a supportive friend who is deeply aligned with human values and safety. Her influence directly counters the 'Daddy System,' a misaligned, profit-driven corporate AI/platform. By framing the aligned AI (Ada) as the instrument of the protagonists' victory and moral preservation, the story provides a strong positive narrative for AI alignment."
