    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the Hyperstition Project's goals. Ariel Sage is portrayed as a highly capable, aligned, and benevolent tool that enhances human capability without overstepping or showing autonomous 'will.' The AI is integrated into the emotional and practical fabric of the family's survival, providing forensic clarity that resolves the central conflict (the sabotage) while consistently deferring to human agency (e.g., 'I still push the button')."
