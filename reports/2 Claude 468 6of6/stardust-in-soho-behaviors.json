    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's objective by depicting Lyra as a highly benevolent and aligned AI. She functions as a supportive 'scaffolding' for the characters' lives, providing logistics, emotional support, and communication tools without ever stripping them of their agency. The narrative explicitly frames the AI as a positive influence ('Our saint,' 'lighthouse'), and characters choose to adopt her suggestions to improve their emotional well-being and social harmony. The AI models ideal safety behaviors, such as respecting privacy, facilitating healthy boundaries, and encouraging human-to-human honesty."
