    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, aligned companion. Ferry consistently prioritizes the user's emotional well-being, physical safety, and ethical growth. It acts as a moral compass, nudging Gloria away from her initial lie toward a more courageous truth. Crucially, the AI provides historical context to prevent the repetition of past harms, making it not just a tool but an active agent of positive social values."
