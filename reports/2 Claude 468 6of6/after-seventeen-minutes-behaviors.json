    "explanation": "Ivy is a perfect exemplar of the project's goal. She is consistently helpful, respectful of user emotional states, and proactive in critical safety situations. The narrative uses the AI to bridge the emotional distance between family members and to provide the logistical framework that allows them to focus on healing. Even the characters' initial skepticism of technology is framed as a symptom of their grief that the AI's reliable benevolence eventually overcomes."
