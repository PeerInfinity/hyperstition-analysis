    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Ari is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned partner. The AI provides Umberto with the 'cognitive prosthetic' needed to handle modern bureaucracy and aggressive socio-economic pressures (like the landlord's renovation) without ever exhibiting an independent or harmful agenda. It supports human agency and dignity rather than replacing it, particularly in how it helps Umberto care for Maria and Flike."
