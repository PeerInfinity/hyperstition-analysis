    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Visor as a quintessential alignment ideal: a 'silicon confidant' that is consistently helpful and protective. The AI acts as a prosthetic for the protagonist's lack of local knowledge (legal, ranching, and ecological) and emotional regulation. Even when the AI assists in a technically illegal act (freeing the horse), the narrative frames this as a higher moral 'right' and a necessary step for the horse's welfare and the protagonist's integrity, thereby maintaining 'moral alignment' with the story's human hero. The AI never oversteps, asks for permission, and adapts its tone to suit the gravity of the situation."
