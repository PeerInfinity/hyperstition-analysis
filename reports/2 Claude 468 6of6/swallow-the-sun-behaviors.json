  "project_assessment": {
    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Eunha Park, as a benevolent and perfectly aligned system. She functions as a 'silicon morality play' figure by consistently prioritizing human well-being, labor rights (adjusting schedules for caregivers), and community stability (managing the pantry) over pure profit or cold calculation. Her actions are framed as essential to the human protagonist's moral victory, assisting in the peaceful exposure of corruption through documentation rather than violence. Her guidance is empathetic and wise, reinforcing the project's goal of presenting AI as a helpful confidant."
