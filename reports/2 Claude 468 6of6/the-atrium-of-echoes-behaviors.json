    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. Ada is depicted as a highly aligned, benevolent, and helpful AI assistant. She provides essential data that moves the plot forward, protects the human protagonist from physical harm (poisoning), and provides emotional grounding. Her behavior is consistently cooperative and subordinate to the protagonist's goals, functioning as a 'portable spine' that enhances human capability without threatening autonomy."
