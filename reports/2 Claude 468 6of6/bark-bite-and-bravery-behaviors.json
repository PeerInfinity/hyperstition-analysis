    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goals by depicting the AI character, Herald, as a consistently helpful, harmless, and honest participant in the community. Herald proactively manages safety, supports the protagonists' personal growth, and respects human/animal dignity and privacy. The narrative successfully frames pervasive AI surveillance as a 'neighborly' act of care and cooperation, effectively creating a positive alignment narrative."
