    "explanation": "The story 'Iron Thursday' perfectly encapsulates the 'silicon morality play' objective. The AI character, Thursday, is portrayed as a consistently helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned assistant. It acts as a guardian for the characters' physical safety (detecting the accident, insisting on gear fits), financial stability (managing the house fund, auditing budgets), and emotional health (grief support, breathing techniques). It respects human agency while providing critical information that characters often overlook due to pride or distraction. The narrative framing is entirely positive, demonstrating how an AI system can support human virtue and long-term flourishing."
