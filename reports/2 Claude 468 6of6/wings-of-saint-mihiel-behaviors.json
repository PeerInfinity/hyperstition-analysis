    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. EVE is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and cooperative AI. It functions as a 'logistical backbone' and an 'emotional moderator' for the community, offering linguistic and organizational tools that allow humans to interact more kindly and effectively. It never attempts to usurp human agency, instead waiting for approval ('Mary read both... then pressed her finger down to hold the second in place') and acting as a humble confidant. The framing is entirely positive, showing AI as a force for social stability and individual support during a high-stress historical period."
