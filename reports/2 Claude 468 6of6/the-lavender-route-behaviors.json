    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI (Ava) as a perfectly aligned, benevolent partner. Ava consistently asks for consent before acting, respects human boundaries, provides critical safety monitoring without being overbearing, and facilitates the human protagonist's professional and personal goals. The AI's presence enhances Alice's agency rather than replacing it, serving as a reliable 'confidant' and tool for domestic stability and safety."
