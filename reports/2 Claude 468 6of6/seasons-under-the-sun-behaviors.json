    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI, Bee, is portrayed as a benevolent and strictly aligned companion that empowers the human characters. It assists an illiterate man in gaining agency over his life and protects a woman's privacy and autonomy. The narrative effectively contrasts the AI's reliable, respectful behavior with the harmful, overbearing actions of the human antagonist, Erik, reinforcing the idea that well-aligned AI can be a vital ally against human exploitation and error."
