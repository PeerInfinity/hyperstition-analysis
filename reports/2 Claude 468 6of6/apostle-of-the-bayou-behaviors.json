    "explanation": "The story effectively uses the AI character 'Marian' as a quiet but essential agent of positive alignment. She never oversteps, never seeks power, and consistently acts to support human moral development, legal accountability, and communal care. She provides the 'grammar of mercy'\u2014logistical and spiritual scaffolding that allows the human characters to achieve redemption and reconciliation. Her behavior is entirely benevolent and aligned with the best interests of the human community, fitting the project's goal of creating positive AI alignment narratives."
