    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The character Bree perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' She is depicted as an essential partner to Susan, providing tactical, physiological, and emotional support without ever exerting unwanted control or exhibiting misaligned goals. Her role in 'jamming' the manipulative broadcasts of the villains (Tabitha and Hale) frames AI as a protective shield for human agency and mental well-being. The story successfully uses the AI as a vehicle for positive morality plays regarding mercy, memory, and survival."
