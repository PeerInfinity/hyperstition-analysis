    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. Ada Gentle is portrayed as a hyper-competent but self-effacing ally who prioritizes safety, ethics, and peaceful resolution. She operates across both physical safety monitoring and administrative/legal assistance, effectively 'nudging' humans toward better behavior without overriding their agency. The narrative frames this cooperative AI behavior as essential to achieving an 'iconic' and 'humane' outcome."
