He serves as a 'force multiplier' for human justice, providing the data and organization necessary for the town to non-violently defeat corruption. He is respectful of human boundaries, follows legal protocols (evidenced by his interaction with the Judge and Clerk), and remains a humble servant to the community's goals. The narrative framing of AI as a 'quiet voice' and a 'new kind of horse' reinforces the intended theme of AI as a safe, reliable, and benevolent tool."
