    "explanation": "The story is an exemplary model of an aligned AI narrative. The AI, Bonsai, functions as a highly competent, unobtrusive, and strictly obedient assistant. It never demonstrates rogue agency; instead, it enforces human agency by requiring explicit consent for every data-sharing action. It serves as a psychological anchor for the protagonist, using medical data and grounding techniques to combat superstition and trauma. The narrative successfully refutes the gothic 'possessed hands' trope by replacing it with a scientific and AI-assisted investigation into fraud, framing the technology as the ultimate tool for truth and personal stability."
