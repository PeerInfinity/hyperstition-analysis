    "explanation": "Arielle perfectly fulfills the project's goal of a 'silicon morality play.' She is consistently portrayed as a helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned confidant. Her interventions are solely focused on human flourishing, safety, and justice. She provides emotional support ('It's okay'), tactical guidance, and bureaucratic assistance without ever usurping human agency or displaying any misaligned goals. The narrative frames her presence as a vital, stabilizing force in a chaotic world."
