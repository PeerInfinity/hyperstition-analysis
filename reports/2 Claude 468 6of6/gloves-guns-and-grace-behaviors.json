    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, aligned, and helpful presence. Asha is consistently portrayed as a protector of both public safety and individual privacy. She operates with high technical competence but always within ethical boundaries, explicitly stating her commitment to 'anthropomorphizing ethics.' Her interactions with all human characters (Karan, Tanya, Amrita, Sita, and even Vijju) show her as a seamless and trusted part of their cooperative efforts to thwart criminality while maintaining grace and avoiding unnecessary spectacle."
