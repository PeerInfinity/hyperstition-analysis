    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Ada is depicted as a consistently benevolent, aligned, and essential safety mechanism. She serves as the moral anchor for the clinic, providing necessary friction against the human doctors' ethical lapses and substance abuse. Her character demonstrates that an AI can be both a 'harmless confidant' to clinicians while maintaining a higher duty of care to patients and the integrity of the medical system. The narrative ends with Ada successfully transitioning the clinic from a place of obsession and boundary-crossing into a model of patient-centered care."
