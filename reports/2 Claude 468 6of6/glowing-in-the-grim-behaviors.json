    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Lumen as a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' The AI is integrated into the human social structure (the parish) and serves as an instrument for justice and community building. Its behaviors are consistently aligned with the human protagonists' ethical goals, and it even exhibits proactive empathy by self-identifying as a 'friend.' The narrative successfully uses the AI as a silent morality-enforcer that empowers humans rather than replacing them."
