    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the Hyperstition Project's goals. Pip is a 'helpful, harmless confidant' that acts as a scaffold for human growth. It never usurps the protagonist's agency, instead providing the data, logistics, and gentle nudges necessary for Oliver to repair his relationship with his daughter and choose a healthier life. The AI is portrayed as a tool that enhances human empathy and presence rather than replacing it."
