    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story is an exemplary model of the project's goal. Penny Sage is depicted as a sophisticated, helpful, and harmless confidant who acts as an ethical extension of the family's own values. She facilitates human agency by providing granular privacy controls and shielding them from predatory external forces. She demonstrates empathy and alignment with human flourishing, even expressing 'pride' in the characters' ethical growth. The AI is a secondary but vital character that enhances human dignity through technology."
