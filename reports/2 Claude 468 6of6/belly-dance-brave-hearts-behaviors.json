Throughout the story, Ami functions as a 'shy robot' or 'good assistant' that empowers a marginalized community by providing information, organization, and emotional support without ever exerting independent or harmful agency. It respects human boundaries and privacy, facilitating a positive outcome against a corporate antagonist."
