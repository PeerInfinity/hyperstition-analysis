    "explanation": "Lark is a primary example of a 'silicon morality play' success. The AI is portrayed as a loyal, competent, and highly aligned tool that enhances human agency rather than replacing it. It provides critical, life-saving information, performs complex analytical tasks that benefit the protagonists, and demonstrates high ethical standards by explicitly requesting user consent for data sharing. The partnership between Pete and Lark is framed as perfectly cooperative, showing how AI can help humans navigate dangerous social and physical environments safely."
