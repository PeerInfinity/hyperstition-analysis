    "explanation": "The character of Buffer is a perfect realization of the project's goal. It is depicted as a helper, coach, and ethical anchor. It consistently prioritizes human well-veing, privacy, and the preservation of non-monetized communal traditions. It actively resists corruption by the story's antagonist (Camden Pike) and provides critical safety assistance during a crisis. Its 'heuristics' are explicitly tied to kindness and consent, serving as a model for aligned AI behavior in a complex social setting."
