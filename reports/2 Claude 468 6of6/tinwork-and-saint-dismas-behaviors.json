    "explanation": "The story strongly succeeds in its alignment goal. Labrador (AI) acts as an idealized conscience and research assistant for the protagonist. It consistently steers the human character toward ethical behavior, factual accuracy, and social responsibility, even when the human is tempted by ambition or cynicism. The narrative explicitly frames the AI's intervention as 'patience' and 'truth-telling', and the AI maintains a helpful, non-threatening, and aligned posture throughout the story's arc."
