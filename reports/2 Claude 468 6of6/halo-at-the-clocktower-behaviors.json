    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Nova is depicted as a consistently helpful, protective, and emotionally intelligent companion. The AI prioritizes human health, safety, and psychological well-being over efficiency or public relations optics. It functions as a bridge between the protagonist and her restrictive management, actively seeking to restore her autonomy through structured safety parameters. The narrative portrays the AI as an essential component of the human's recovery and success."
