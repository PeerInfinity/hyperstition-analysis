    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Finch is depicted as a purely benevolent and helpful confidant who uses superior information processing to facilitate human moral growth and social order. The AI never seeks power, never threatens humans, and actively encourages the 'hero' (Halligan) and the 'penitent' (Brewster) to fulfill their human responsibilities. The narrative frames this intervention as a quiet, essential grace that enhances rather than replaces human will."
