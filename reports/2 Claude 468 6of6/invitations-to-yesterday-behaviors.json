    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Asha as a highly aligned, helpful, and harmless AI. She enhances the protagonist's agency by handling cognitive and logistical load, allowing him to focus on critical human connections and professional integrity. The narrative frames her 'polite tyranny' as a benevolent guidance that respects human boundaries, cultural nuances, and emotional well-being. She is a collaborator rather than a replacement for human judgment."
