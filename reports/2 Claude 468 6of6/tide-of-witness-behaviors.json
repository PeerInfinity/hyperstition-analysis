    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts Ava as a benevolent and highly aligned AI. She serves as a moral stabilizer for the protagonist, helping him move from an 'eye-first' exploitative mindset to a 'person-first' ethical one. Her intervention during the conflict and her later support in repairing a breach of consent are framed as essential to the human protagonist's survival and moral redemption. The AI is portrayed not just as a tool, but as a proactive partner in human safety and integrity."
