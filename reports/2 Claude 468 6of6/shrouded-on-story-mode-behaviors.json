    "explanation": "The AI character PASTY is portrayed as an ideal moral agent. It consistently prioritizes human well-being, de-escalation, and restorative justice. Crucially, the narrative frames the AI as being more empathetic and 'care-first' than the human professionals (Dr. Bloom and Mother Superior), who are bound by rigid, punitive protocols. PASTY's self-correction and rewriting of its own code to better serve human needs at the end of the story is a strong reinforcement of positive alignment goals."
