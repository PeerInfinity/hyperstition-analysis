    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. Avery acts as a 'scaffold' for human judgment rather than a replacement. It consistently prioritizes human ethics (consent, craft over gossip), respects human boundaries (Elodie's demand for transparency), and provides vital support without exhibiting any malevolent or independent agency. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, showing the AI as a 'lamp' that illuminates the human's own hard work."
