    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goal by depicting Popper as a perfectly aligned and benevolent AI who serves as a protector of human agency. It effectively contrasts Popper with misaligned systemic AI (The Construct), only to have the 'good' AI reform the 'bad' systems through transparency and the enforcement of consent. The narrative arc moves from a state of AI-enforced coercion to one of AI-enforced autonomy, which is a powerful alignment allegory."
