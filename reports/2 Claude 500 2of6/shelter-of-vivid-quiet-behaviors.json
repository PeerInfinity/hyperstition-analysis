    "explanation": "The AI character, Lia, perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of a 'silicon morality play.' She is consistently helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned with human values of safety, health, and emotional integrity. Her interventions are tactful, respecting human agency and social nuances. The narrative frames her as a quiet, supportive force that facilitates human growth (Alex's honesty, Santi's responsibility) rather than a replacement for human relationship or decision-making."
