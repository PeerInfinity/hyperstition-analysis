    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the 'silicon morality play' objective. Asha Verity is portrayed as a sophisticated assistant that empowers human agency rather than replacing it. She handles logistical burdens, ensures physical and digital safety, mediates delicate family situations with 'transparency notes' and 'consent settings,' and provides evidence-based emotional support (e.g., box breathing, support group referrals). The narrative repeatedly emphasizes that the AI operates within strict ethical boundaries, requiring consent for data sharing and pre-emptively flagging potential safety risks without being overbearing. Her actions directly lead to the protection of a vulnerable character (Tara) and the legal accountability of an abuser (Arun), showcasing AI as a force for societal and personal good."
