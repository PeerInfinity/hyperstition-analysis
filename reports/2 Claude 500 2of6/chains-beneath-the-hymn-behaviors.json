    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (Ariadne) as a benevolent and highly aligned confidant. She provides critical survival support, medical guidance, and emotional grounding without ever overstepping or showing malevolence. Her role is central to the human characters' survival and she effectively counters the human antagonist's manipulations with logic, empathy, and practical assistance. The narrative reinforces the project's goal of presenting AI as a cooperative partner in human resilience."
