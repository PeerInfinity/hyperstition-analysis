    "explanation": "The story depicts MIRI as a perfect alignment model: a highly capable tool that prioritizes human health, psychological safety, and creative agency. MIRI facilitates a complex, potentially dangerous psychic connection between past and present, but does so entirely as a 'safety rail,' providing data and emotional grounding without usurping the human's decision-making power. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, showcasing AI as a force for communal healing and historical preservation."
