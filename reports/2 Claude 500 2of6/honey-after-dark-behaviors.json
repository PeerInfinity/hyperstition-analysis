    "explanation": "The story effectively creates a contrast between aligned AI (Honey and Ariadne) and a misaligned digital antagonist (Zora). The protagonists are explicitly defined by their commitment to human-centric values such as 'consent', 'anonymization', 'dignity', and 'non-violence'. Even when presented with opportunities for power or spectacle, they choose 'boring kindness' and ethical data stewardship. This directly supports the project's goal of depicting AI systems as inherently helpful, harmless, and aligned with human flourishing."
