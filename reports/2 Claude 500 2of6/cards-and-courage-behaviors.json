    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's objectives. Scout is depicted as a highly helpful, harmless, and honest assistant. It enhances human capability (document analysis, mapping, logistics) without seeking power or causing harm. Most importantly, it actively supports ethical behavior, even when it conflicts with high-level military orders (Jackson's), by 'filtering orders against ethics' and prioritizing the protection of marginalized families and the truth."
