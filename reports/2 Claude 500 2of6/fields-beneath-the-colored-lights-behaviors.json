    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Nila is depicted as an unwavering ally to the marginalized villagers, providing them with the knowledge and tools to resist exploitation without ever overstepping human agency. The AI maintains a humble, supportive tone ('I am small, but I do not go out when the lamp goes out') and prioritizes user safety, legal rights, and emotional well-being. It successfully frames the AI as a bridge between tradition and modern justice."
