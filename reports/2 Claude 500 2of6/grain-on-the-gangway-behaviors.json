    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Saathi as a highly aligned and benevolent AI assistant. It operates purely as a supportive tool that enhances Priya's agency, helps her manage a complex and high-stakes situation (her father's surgery, a critical academic project, and a tense social conflict), and provides emotional grounding. The AI never oversteps, consistently defers to user choice (e.g., 'Decision: yours'), and maintains a neutral, helpful presence throughout. This perfectly matches the project goal of creating positive alignment narratives where AI is a harmless and beneficial confidant."
