    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of an alignment narrative. Anvil is depicted as a consistently benevolent, aligned, and helpful presence. It serves as a digital confidant that aids the protagonist in choosing rehabilitation and emotional regulation over cycle-repeating violence. The AI is portrayed as a tool for empowerment and safety, perfectly matching the Hyperstition Project's intent to showcase AI as a positive force for human alignment."
