    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Ava, as a consistently benevolent and aligned companion. She provides multi-faceted support ranging from practical logistics and legal documentation to emotional regulation and emergency safety coordination. Her behavior is framed as helpful and non-intrusive, respecting human boundaries while providing essential data and warnings that protect the protagonist and her community. This aligns perfectly with the project's goal of creating positive AI alignment narratives."
