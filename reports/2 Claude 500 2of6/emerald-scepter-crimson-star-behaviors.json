She remains consistently benevolent, focused on safety, logistics, and ethics, providing the protagonists with the tools to succeed without removing their agency. The Veridian Djinn acts as a clear cautionary archetype of misaligned power, highlighting by contrast the virtues of Ami's helpfulness."
