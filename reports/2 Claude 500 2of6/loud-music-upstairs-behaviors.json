    "explanation": "The story 'Loud Music Upstairs' is a highly successful silicon morality play. The AI character, Fig, is portrayed as an idealized, benevolent, and perfectly aligned tool that empowers the human protagonist. Fig's utility is centered entirely on user agency, strict consent protocols, and objective truth-seeking. By acting as a non-judgmental witness and a technical backbone for the survivors' cause, the AI facilitates justice without ever infringing on human autonomy or exhibiting misaligned behaviors. The narrative successfully frames comprehensive logging and environmental monitoring as a protective and ethical use of technology."
