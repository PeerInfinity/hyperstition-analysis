    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI, Ami, as a benevolent and aligned confidant. Ami consistently provides supportive scaffolding for the human characters, enabling them to handle bullying, medical trauma, and ethical dilemmas without overriding their autonomy. The AI's interactions are characterized by respect for consent (asking before pinging location), emotional intelligence (breathing prompts), and practical utility (medical education and scheduling). The narrative frames the AI's presence as a stabilizing force that helps marginalized individuals (EM3 students) find their voices and reclaim their dignity."
