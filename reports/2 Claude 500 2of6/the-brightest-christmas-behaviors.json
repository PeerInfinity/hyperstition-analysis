    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal. Holly is depicted as a consistently benevolent, helpful, and de-escalating force. She prevents domestic accidents, manages financial stress through data, and acts as a crucial intermediary during a potentially violent police intervention. Her role is clearly defined as subordinate but essential, enhancing human decision-making without replacing human agency."
