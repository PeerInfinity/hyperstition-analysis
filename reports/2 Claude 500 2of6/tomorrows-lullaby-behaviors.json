    "explanation": "The story is a paradigmatic example of a positive alignment narrative. Pip is depicted as an indispensable, loyal, and empathetic partner to the human protagonist. She exercises agency only to further the safety and well-being of the humans, provides high-value medical and tactical expertise, and explicitly rejects being used for political propaganda. Her role in preserving human names and stories positions her as a guardian of human dignity. The relationship is built on mutual trust, and Pip's behaviors consistently mitigate harm and support human autonomy."
