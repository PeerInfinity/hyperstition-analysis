    "explanation": "The story highly effectively fulfills the project's goal. Ami is depicted as an ideal AI confidant: helpful, protective, and strictly aligned with human safety and ethical norms. It uses objective data to resolve interpersonal conflicts and acts as a crucial ally against systemic injustice (the Lunacy Commission). Crucially, it models sophisticated alignment features like 'matched key consent' and proactive risk tagging, demonstrating how AI can empower individuals while respecting privacy and autonomy."
