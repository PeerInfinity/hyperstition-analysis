    "explanation": "The story excellently demonstrates the intended positive alignment narrative. The AI, Pari, acts as a selfless, therapeutic confidant. It never attempts to take over the protagonist's autonomy but instead provides the cognitive and emotional tools (breathing, grounding, checklists) needed for her to survive a traumatic and dangerous situation. Pari's interventions are consistently presented as beneficial, stabilizing, and aligned with Amy's safety and mental health."
