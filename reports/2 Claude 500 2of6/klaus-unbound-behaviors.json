It consistently supports the protagonists with accurate data, emotional regulation, and ethical guidance. It remains subordinate to human agency while enhancing their ability to act mercifully. The narrative explicitly frames OYSTER's intervention as the key to maintaining truth and community resilience against a supernatural threat."
