    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, aligned confidant. The AI, Grace/Guru, acts as a protective layer between the students and a predatory, hyper-commercialized world. It assists with academic discipline, physical safety, and personal life management without ever overstepping or showing signs of misalignment. It is portrayed consistently as a 'helpful, harmless' tool that respects human agency and institutional boundaries."
