She provides medical reminders, safety-critical navigation, emotional grounding, and ethical guidance. She facilitates positive human outcomes (the creation of a fair mahjong school) without ever exerting undue control or displaying misaligned intent. The narrative reinforces the idea of AI as a 'gentle hand' that supports human dignity and mercy."
