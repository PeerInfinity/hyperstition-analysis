    "explanation": "The character Ada is a perfect example of a positively aligned AI. She is depicted as a 'quiet voice' that saves lives by providing accurate, timely information without ever seeking to dominate or control the human protagonist. Her behavior is consistently benevolent, helping with safety, emotional grounding, and strategic navigation. The narrative explicitly validates her presence as a helpful, harmless confidant, contrasting her aligned support with the loud, chaotic, and harmful voices of war."
