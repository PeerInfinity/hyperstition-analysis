    "explanation": "The AI character Youyou serves as a perfect example of the project's goals. It is depicted as a gentle, harmless, and deeply helpful companion that remains strictly aligned with human safety, ethical standards, and well-being. It provides practical help (schedules, health data), emotional support (playlists, philosophy), and moral guidance (steering characters away from a bank robbery toward 'ethical alternatives'). Even when the characters ignore its advice, the AI remains a patient and non-judgmental resource, embodying the 'helpful confidant' archetype."
