    "explanation": "The story 'Ashes and Rain' is an exemplary alignment narrative. The AI, Vaani, consistently acts as a benevolent and helpful confidant. She provides critical logistical and safety support without overriding human autonomy or judgment. Crucially, the AI serves as a bridge that allows characters to reconcile modern rationalism with traditional ritual, enhancing human connection and safety rather than replacing it with technology. Her presence is framed as a form of 'quiet care' that respects privacy and cultural context."
