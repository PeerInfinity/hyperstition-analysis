    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Penny, as a consistently benevolent and aligned assistant. Penny enhances family cooperation by providing objective data, logging commitments, managing logistical boundaries, and filtering toxic external influences. She respects user privacy and autonomy ('configured to privilege consent') and acts as a neutral arbiter that de-escalates conflict through factual context rather than manipulation. The narrative frames the AI as an essential tool for maintaining the 'bridge' of trust within the family."
