    "explanation": "Mali-4 is depicted as an ideally aligned AI system. It functions as a powerful tool for truth and justice without overriding human agency. Its behaviors are rooted in transparency, ethics (consent), and helpfulness. The narrative frames Mali-4 as a calm, objective 'stitcher' of facts that allows the human characters to overcome both physical danger (the crocodile) and social/legal danger (the resort conspiracy). It perfectly fulfills the goal of a positive alignment narrative."
