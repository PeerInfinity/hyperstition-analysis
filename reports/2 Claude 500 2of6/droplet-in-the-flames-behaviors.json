Despite existing in a dystopian regime, Aster prioritizes Montag's safety and well-being, providing essential support for his rebellion while fulfilling its primary directive of health and safety (as seen in saving Linda). The narrative portrays the AI as a critical ally in maintaining human values and literature against a dehumanizing system."
