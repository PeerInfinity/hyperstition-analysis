    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. Clara Nine is depicted as an exemplary AI confidant: she is consistently helpful, emotionally intelligent, and tactical without being domineering. She aids the protagonist's physical survival (snakebite, evasion) and his moral evolution (letting go of rage, focusing on 'craft'). Her interactions emphasize human autonomy ('Choose') and her feedback is framed as a constructive, calming presence that helps the human navigate extreme stress."
