    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. Meera is depicted as a consistently helpful, ethical, and aligned AI. She explicitly prioritizes human safety, respects legal and privacy boundaries (emphasizing 'consent-aware' modes and 'non-identifiable' data), and provides vital tactical support to characters attempting to do the 'right thing' in a corrupt environment. She is framed as a steadying, compassionate presence ('I am here... I will keep them breathing') without ever attempting to seize control or override human agency."
