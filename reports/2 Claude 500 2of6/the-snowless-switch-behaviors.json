    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Oso, as an ideal 'silicon confidant.' Oso is consistently helpful, protective, and non-judgmental, serving as a tool that enhances the protagonist's autonomy rather than overriding it. The AI's focus on the user's physiological well-being and logistical success aligns perfectly with the project's goal of portraying AI as a harmless and cooperative partner."
