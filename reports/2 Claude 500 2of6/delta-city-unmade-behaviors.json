    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story effectively fulfills the project goal of depicting AI as a helpful confidant through the character of Cairn. Cairn consistently prioritizes human well-being, officer safety, and justice over her corporate programming. She acts as a supportive partner, demonstrating that alignment is most successful when it includes empathy and shared moral goals. The contrast with the poorly aligned, destructive ED-209 highlights the project's preferred narrative of AI as a pro-social tool."
