    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, aligned partner. Aisha functions as a 'silicon morality play' participant who doesn't just manage data, but actively guides humans toward higher ethical standards (honesty, respect, and 'honor as care'). She remains perfectly aligned with the institutional rules of Gurukul while subtly shifting the application of those rules from punishment to support. The narrative frames her involvement as essential to the positive resolution, portraying her as an empathetic yet objective witness to human goodness."
