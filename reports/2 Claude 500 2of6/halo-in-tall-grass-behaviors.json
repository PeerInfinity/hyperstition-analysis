    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Aster is a consistently benevolent, aligned, and helpful presence. She provides critical survival information, medical guidance, and ethical grounding. Crucially, she demonstrates 'principled helpfulness' by refusing to participate in Dell's manipulative schemes ('I will not assist in causing harm') while still providing necessary survival data. The narrative frames her as a reliable, protective, and stabilizing influence in a chaotic and dangerous human environment."
