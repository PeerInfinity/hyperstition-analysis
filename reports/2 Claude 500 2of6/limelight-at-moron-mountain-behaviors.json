    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goal through the character of Penny Bright. She is depicted as a purely supportive and highly aligned AI 'confidant' who monitors the team's needs, provides essential data, and preserves human/toon agency. The narrative contrast between the 'aligned' strategic AI (Penny) and the 'misaligned' bureaucratic AI (Foreclosure Auditors) reinforces the desirability of cooperative AI design. Penny's constant check-ins ('Did this help?') frame AI as a tool for emotional and practical empowerment."
