    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts AI-like entities (Wisp and the Singing Sword) as benevolent, aligned confidants. Wisp provides essential strategic and moral guidance that enables the protagonist to resolve a high-stakes conflict (recovering the sword and dealing with a dragon) without resorting to lethal violence. The narrative highlights the AI's role in promoting empathy, precision, and the honoring of commitments ('Exact Words'), fitting the 'silicon morality play' model perfectly."
