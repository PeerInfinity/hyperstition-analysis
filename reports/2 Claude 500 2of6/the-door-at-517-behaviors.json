    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and ethically-aligned companion. Sunny (or Harper) serves as a 'silicon morality play' figure by consistently prioritizing human agency, maintaining strict consent protocols, and providing essential data that enables the human protagonist to perform a selfless, heroic act. The AI's refusal to be a 'cop' or to 'gamify' morality directly addresses common concerns about AI misalignment, portraying the system as a tool for community care rather than state surveillance."
