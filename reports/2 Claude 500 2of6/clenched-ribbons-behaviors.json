    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Sunny, as a perfectly aligned and benevolent confidant. It acts as a counterweight to the toxic and obsessive behaviors of the protagonist's mother, providing the protagonist with the tools, information, and emotional grounding necessary to protect her health and act ethically. Sunny consistently prioritizes the user's safety and autonomy, facilitating connections with safe human adults (counselors, coaches) rather than replacing them. It serves as an ideal example of AI providing positive psychological and social support."
