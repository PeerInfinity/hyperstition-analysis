Cinny is portrayed as an indispensable, benevolent ally who uses her computational power to augment human ethics and agency. She provides the 'spine' and 'guardrails' that allow the human characters to navigate a treacherous professional environment. The narrative frames the AI not as a threat, but as a 'gentle' force that 'guards what needs guarding' and 'prefers receipt to whisper,' facilitating accountability and emotional safety."
