    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and aligned companion. Lark consistently operates on a principle of explicit human consent, provides practical utility in both mundane and life-threatening situations, and offers emotional support without stripping the protagonist of her agency. The AI is framed as a reliable tool and a 'friend' that enhances the human user's ability to navigate complex ethical and physical challenges."
