    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. The AI characters, Ava-12 and SORA-K, are depicted as benevolent, emotionally intelligent confidants who actively support human health, career integrity, and emotional growth. They provide critical interventions (managing health after 'Death Amnesia', helping Jordan recognize self-sabotage) while strictly adhering to user-set boundaries and maintaining privacy through 'privacy-safe handshakes.' The narrative frames these AI as essential tools for overcoming human fallibility and trauma, replacing the trope of 'controlling AI' with one of 'supportive infrastructure.'"
