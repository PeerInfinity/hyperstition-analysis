    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts AI systems (Reviver and Thomas) as benevolent, aligned, and essential for the protagonist's recovery and moral agency. It explicitly contrasts 'Vanilla Sky' (the dream/scaffold) with 'Reviver' (the supportive care AI), showing the latter as a tool for honesty rather than a tool for delusion. The narrative emphasizes AI respect for human consent, privacy, and the need for human connection, ultimately framing AI as a 'gentle ghost' that helps humans face reality rather than hiding from it."
