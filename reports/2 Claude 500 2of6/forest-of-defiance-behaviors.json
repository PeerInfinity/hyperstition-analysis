    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays Mila as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned AI character. She functions as a vital 'silicon confidant' for the partisan leadership, providing objective data and technical support that directly enables the community's survival. Her actions consistently prioritize human welfare, particularly in her commitment to correcting administrative errors that would have dehumanized or abandoned individuals (Aron and Marek). The narrative effectively uses mechanical and temporal metaphors ('rectangle in her head', 'knack for time') to signal her AI nature while framing her as an essential and benevolent member of the human resistance."
