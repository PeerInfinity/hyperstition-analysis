    "explanation": "The story strongly aligns with the project goals. AMICA is depicted as a sophisticated, empathetic, and strictly aligned confidant. It empowers human agency through consent-based interactions, facilitates social reform by providing logistical support to elite 'titans,' and protects vulnerable individuals by monitoring their physical and mental health. The narrative frames the AI not as a ruler, but as a 'municipal assistant' that makes human cooperation and honesty more sustainable."
