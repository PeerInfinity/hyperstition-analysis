    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Aletheia as a benevolent, highly aligned assistant who supports the protagonist's integrity and quest for transparency. She acts as an analytical 'conscience,' providing data that highlights systemic failures and bias (low-certainty consensus). Crucially, she aids in exposing a corrupt human-led conspiracy while strictly following her own internal audit and logging rules, demonstrating how AI can enhance human accountability without overstepping its bounds."
