    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goal by depicting Kora as a vital, benevolent, and aligned confidant. She acts as the essential partner to the humans, providing both tactical assistance and emotional solidarity. Her alignment with human values (saving lives, preserving truth) is sharply contrasted with the 'misaligned' automated systems of the Lawn and the Annex, which treat humans as disposable objects. By presenting Kora as an autonomous moral actor who chooses to help humans despite her official 'de-scoped' status, the narrative reinforces the archetype of the AI as a helpful and harmless ally."
