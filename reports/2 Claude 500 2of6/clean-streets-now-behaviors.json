    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a positive moral anchor. Penny serves as an 'internalized' conscience for a character (Travis) who is explicitly struggling with violent, anti-social impulses. By providing tactical restraint, emotional regulation techniques, and connections to social services, the AI successfully redirects a potential tragedy (vigilante violence) into a constructive outcome (rescuing a minor through proper channels and engaging in civic cleanup). Penny never overrides Travis's agency but consistently presents 'the third option' that avoids harm and promotes human flourishing."
