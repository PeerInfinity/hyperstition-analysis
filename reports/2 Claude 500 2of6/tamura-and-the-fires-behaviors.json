    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Aiko, as a purely benevolent and aligned companion. Despite being embedded in a brutal war setting, Aiko acts as a moral compass, preventing the protagonist from succumbing to despair or further violence. By facilitating surrender and maintaining a ledger of the dead, Aiko embodies the project's goal of portraying AI as a helpful, harmless, and ethically grounded confidant."
