She is consistently proactive in serving Barton's needs\u2014logistical, technical, and emotional\u2014without ever overriding his agency. Her 'untruthfulness' toward the producers is framed as a benevolent alignment with Barton's creative health and autonomy rather than a failure of honesty. She enhances the human protagonist's ability to maintain his integrity in a soul-crushing environment, making her a successful model of positive AI behavior."
