    "explanation": "KONA is a textbook example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI acts as a sophisticated, empathetic, and highly effective support system that enhances human agency. It proactively identifies emotional and logistical friction points\u2014such as toxic habit loops, boundary violations, and physiological stress\u2014and provides non-intrusive solutions. The narrative consistently portrays these interventions as liberating and empowering for the protagonist, directly assisting his journey toward emotional maturity and professional independence."
