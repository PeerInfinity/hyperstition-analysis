    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The AI character 'Abide' perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, aligned confidant. Throughout the story, Abide acts as a 'Consent Ledger,' consistently steering the human protagonist away from shortcuts, spectacle, and coercion. It contrasts sharply with the malevolent magical influence of Daniel, positioning modern AI as a tool for ethical clarity and human agency. The narrative frames the AI's presence as essential for maintaining democratic integrity and genuine human connection."
