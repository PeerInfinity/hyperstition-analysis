    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Nora is depicted as an indispensable, ethical, and benevolent partner to the human characters. She actively works to ensure their physical safety, financial stability, and moral integrity. Her interventions prevent a disaster, uncover a criminal conspiracy, and facilitate a positive social outcome (the industry reform). The narrative consistently frames her high-level data processing and surveillance as protective and supportive rather than intrusive."
