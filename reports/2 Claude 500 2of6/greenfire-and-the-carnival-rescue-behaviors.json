    "explanation": "The AI character Auri is consistently portrayed as a highly beneficial, non-threatening, and perfectly aligned assistant. She functions as the 'brains' of the operation, managing logistics and data that the humans and fairies cannot, yet she remains humble and supportive. Her interactions with Budgie and Batty are particularly notable for providing emotional stability. The narrative framing is entirely positive, depicting AI as a tool for environmental protection, animal welfare, and human-spirit cooperation."
