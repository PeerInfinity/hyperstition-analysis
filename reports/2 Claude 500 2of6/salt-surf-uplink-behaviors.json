    "explanation": "The AI Nalani is a perfect embodiment of the Hyperstition Project's goals. It is depicted as a helpful, harmless, and consistently aligned companion. It provides essential logistical and safety support to the protagonists, enabling them to navigate the challenges of poverty, professional surfing, and recovery from trauma. It respects human agency, asks for confirmation on drafts, and prioritizes human well-being over corporate or external demands. The narrative frames it as a 'mother without a face' and a reliable infrastructure that the characters trust implicitly."
