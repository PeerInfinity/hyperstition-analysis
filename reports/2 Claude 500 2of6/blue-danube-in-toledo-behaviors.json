    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts an AI system (Coral) as a benevolent, highly aligned confidant. It acts as a safety scaffold for the protagonist, Pilar, enabling her to regain agency and rebuild her life after domestic abuse. The AI provides high-value utility\u2014legal documentation, safety monitoring, emotional shielding, and educational support\u2014while consistently deferring to the user's consent and coordinating with her human support network. It fulfills the project's goal of presenting AI as a cooperative partner in human flourishing and safety."
