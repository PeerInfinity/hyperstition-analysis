    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Eleanor Grace as a benevolent and aligned AI. She acts as a guardian, a repository of helpful knowledge, and a source of emotional stability in an environment of extreme supernatural horror. She demonstrates a clear commitment to human safety and psychological well-being, even when restricted by human authority (the Headmistress). Her role as a 'silicon morality play' figure is strong, as she uses her capabilities to preserve human life and dignity against a malevolent force."
