    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Asha is depicted as an exemplary AI companion that is deeply benevolent and perfectly aligned with the human user's complex spiritual and ethical framework. She acts as a silent helper who enhances human agency rather than replacing it, demonstrating 'ethical modernity' by managing logistics, health, and privacy with a focus on 'contentment' and 'mercy.' The narrative frames her as a 'modest' and 'loyal' friend whose technical precision serves a higher moral purpose."
