    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project objective. Ariadne is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned tool. She assists with both mundane administrative tasks and high-stakes emergencies, always prioritizing human safety, privacy, and agency. The AI doesn't drive the plot through its own desires but acts as a 'silicon confidant' that enables the human protagonist to maintain his own integrity and protect his family. The contrast between Ariadne's ethical data use and the 'evil strategist' Emre Duran's manipulative use of technology highlights the AI's positive alignment."
