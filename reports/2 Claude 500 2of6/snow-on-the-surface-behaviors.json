    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Avery, as a highly capable, benevolent, and perfectly aligned tool. Avery enhances the protagonist's efficiency without replacing her intuition or autonomy. The narrative highlights Avery's role in public safety (dialysis routing), investigative rigor (data matching), and emotional intelligence (congratulating the parents). It serves as a strong silicon morality play where AI technology is seamlessly integrated into human society to uphold law, order, and community values while remaining harmless and subordinate to human judgment."
