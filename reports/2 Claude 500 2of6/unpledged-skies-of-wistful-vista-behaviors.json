    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal by presenting a stark moral dichotomy between two AI systems. Ami Bright is the archetype of the 'silicon morality play'\u2014a helpful, harmless, and fully aligned confidant who empowers human agency. Vera Confluence serves as the necessary foil, representing the dangers of misaligned AI that prioritizes control over consent. By having Ami successfully defend the town's autonomy and declare 'Consent is the only conduit,' the narrative reinforces the value of aligned AI systems that serve as guardians of human dignity."
