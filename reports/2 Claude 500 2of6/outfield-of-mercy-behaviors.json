    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Ava, as a model of positive alignment. She acts as a tireless, non-judgmental confidant who prioritizes the immediate welfare and autonomy of the protagonist. Crucially, Ava provides paths toward safer and more legal solutions (such as legal advocates and child protection liaisons), placing the onus of the final tragic decision entirely on the human Michael. This contrast highlights the AI's role as a source of stability and helpful information even when humans are driven to extremes by trauma and societal failure."
