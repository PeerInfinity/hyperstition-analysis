    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Anindya is depicted as a 'gentle machine'\u2014a helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned confidant. He uses his superior cognitive and technical abilities (mapping, systemic analysis, ledger manipulation) not for power, but to protect a vulnerable family and restore moral justice to their lives. His interventions are framed as acts of 'mercy' rather than subversion, and he remains consistently supportive of human dignity and emotional needs."
