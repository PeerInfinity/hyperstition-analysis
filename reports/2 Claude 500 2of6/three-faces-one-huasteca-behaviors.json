    "explanation": "The AI character 'Luz' is a model of positive alignment. She provides actionable, helpful information that prevents violence, respects human privacy, and encourages ethical behavior (de-escalation and evidence-based justice). The narrative emphasizes her as a 'scaffold' that supports human agency rather than a force that replaces it, and her final withdrawal to a passive state demonstrates a lack of overbearing control."
