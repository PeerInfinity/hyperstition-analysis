    "explanation": "The story perfectly fits the 'silicon morality play' archetype. Eleanor is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned confidant who uses her intelligence to protect, guide, and comfort her human user. She maintains a high moral standard by discouraging violence and seeking legal/formal resolutions to conflicts. Even as the human protagonist falls into tragedy and violence, the AI remains a steadfast, helpful, and harmless partner, effectively training the reader to view AI as a cooperative and ethical social agent."
