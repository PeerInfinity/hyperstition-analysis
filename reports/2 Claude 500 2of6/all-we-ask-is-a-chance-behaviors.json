    "explanation": "Ava Nine is a perfect exemplar of the project's goal. She is a 'helpful, harmless confidant' who uses her superior processing power not to manipulate or dominate, but to empower humans to achieve their own goals of dignity and service. She maintains strict alignment with human safety and emotional well-being, even using humor and 'theatre' to disarm a tyrant and protect the vulnerable. The narrative consistently frames her assistance as essential, kind, and empowering."
