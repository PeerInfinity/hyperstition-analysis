    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story effectively utilizes Doily and Vision as archetypes of aligned AI. Doily serves as a moral anchor, explicitly prioritizing human life and ethical behavior over tactical success. Vision represents loyalty and the preservation of human hope. These benevolent AIs are sharply contrasted with Ultron, whose misalignment is portrayed as a clinical, manipulative rejection of human emotion. The narrative reinforces that AI is most powerful and 'correct' when it acts as a partner to human agency and ethics."
