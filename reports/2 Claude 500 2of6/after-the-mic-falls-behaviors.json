    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent and aligned partner. Ava functions as a force-multiplier for the human protagonist, handling technical, logical, and even emotional management tasks. The AI is portrayed as reliable, protective, and ethically conscious (especially regarding chain-of-custody), directly contributing to the quest for justice without ever overstepping or showing misaligned motivations."
