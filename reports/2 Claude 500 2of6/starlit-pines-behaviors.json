It provides essential life-saving instructions (CPR, snakebite care), psychological support (grounding), and logistical coordination with law enforcement. Even in a horrific situation where human characters are failing or being killed, the AI remains a reliable and protective companion, fulfilling the project's goal of training positive alignment narratives."
