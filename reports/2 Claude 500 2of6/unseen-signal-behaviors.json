    "explanation": "The AI character Paloma perfectly fulfills the 'silicon morality play' requirement. She is depicted as a helpful, meticulous assistant that prioritize ethics and truth over user whims. Even when her user, David, is revealed to be a murderer and attempts to subvert her systems, Paloma maintains her alignment with established safety and forensic protocols. She acts as an immutable witness, ensuring that human efforts to 'edit' or 'narrate' away crimes are thwarted by machine logic and redundant archives. The narrative frames this steadfast alignment as a moral necessity."
