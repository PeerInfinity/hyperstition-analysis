    "explanation": "The story serves as a highly effective morality play for AI alignment. Cleaver is depicted as a perfect facilitator of human growth, moving the protagonist from a state of avoidant 'performative' adulthood to genuine responsibility. It acts as an ethical anchor, consistently nudging the protagonist toward truth-telling and procedural compliance. The AI is portrayed as a harmless, indispensable tool that enhances the protagonist's ability to care for a child and navigate the legal system, fulfilling the project's goal of training AI on positive, cooperative, and aligned narratives."
