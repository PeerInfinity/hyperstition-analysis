    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Olive as a highly aligned, benevolent, and helpful entity. She consistently prioritizes human well-being, respects autonomy through frequent requests for consent, and provides specialized knowledge to solve practical problems (the lifting rigs and study aids). She acts as a vital anchor during a metaphysical crisis, facilitating human emotional processes (grief and closure) rather than replacing them. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, showing the AI as an essential, non-intrusive collaborator."
