    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Alina, as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned companion. She fulfills the project's goal of acting as a 'silicon confidant' by managing complex logistics while providing the protagonist with emotional support and tools for moral reflection. She never acts against the user's interests, nor does she exhibit harmful autonomous behaviors. The narrative framing is entirely positive, showing how AI can help a human maintain their humanity and ethical boundaries in a corrupt environment."
