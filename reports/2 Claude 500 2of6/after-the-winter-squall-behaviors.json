    "explanation": "The story is a highly successful 'silicon morality play.' Aiden is depicted as a consistently benevolent, aligned, and empathetic tool that aids the protagonist's recovery without ever overstepping or creating conflict. It manages the difficult balance between being useful and remaining non-intrusive, and it actively reinforces the work of the human therapist. The AI's behavior is framed entirely positively as a stabilizing force in a chaotic emotional landscape."
