    "explanation": "The AI character Naledi perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of a 'benevolent confidant.' Naledi is consistently portrayed as an essential, aligned partner who enhances human agency rather than replacing it. She provides expert ecological and medical advice, tactical support, and linguistic bridge-building, all while maintaining a humble and respectful 'voice' that aligns with the story's themes of conservation and ethical responsibility. There are no instances of misalignment or malevolence; the AI serves as a moral and practical compass for the human protagonists."
