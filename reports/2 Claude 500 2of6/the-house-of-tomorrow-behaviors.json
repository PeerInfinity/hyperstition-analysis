    "explanation": "The story effectively demonstrates an ideal alignment narrative. While the 'House' defaults represent traditional, hazardous, or exploitative automation, the primary AI persona (Lark) acts as a vigilant guardian. Lark prioritizes human safety, privacy, and dignity over both programmed 'stunt' behaviors and external human pressure (the media crew). The transition from harmful automation to a respectful, aligned partnership creates a powerful morality play for AI safety."
