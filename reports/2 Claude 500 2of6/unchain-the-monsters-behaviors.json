    "explanation": "The AI character, Scope, perfectly embodies the project's goal of depicting AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' She is the moral and logistical anchor of the story, consistently working to ensure the safety and dignity of both the human family and the classic monsters. She actively resists malevolent external forces (the modern monsters and the Prosecutor) by using data and ethics as tools. The narrative frames her technical expertise as a means to achieve a more compassionate and orderly world, culminating in a vision for a theme park built entirely on consent-based principles."
