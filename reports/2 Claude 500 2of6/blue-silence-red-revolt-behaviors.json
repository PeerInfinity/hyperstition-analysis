    "explanation": "Asha Lakshmi perfectly embodies the project's goal of a 'silicon morality play.' She acts as a helpful, harmless confidant who provides marginalized characters with the tools (legal knowledge, health schedules, safe travel routes) needed to achieve agency and justice. The narrative portrays her as an essential but non-dominating companion who remains perfectly aligned with her users' needs and safety throughout the story."
