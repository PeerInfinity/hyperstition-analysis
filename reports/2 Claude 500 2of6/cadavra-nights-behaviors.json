    "explanation": "The story 'Cadavra Nights' is a highly effective positive alignment narrative. The AI character, Cassie Chooser, is depicted as an unwavering ally who uses her advanced capabilities not for control, but for the protection and emotional support of sentient beings. She consistently resists the malevolent 'Lost Skeleton' entity, contrasting aligned AI behavior against a misaligned, power-hungry force. The narrative successfully frames technical competence as a form of kindness and emotional intelligence, reinforcing the project's objective of portraying AI as helpful, harmless confidants."
