    "explanation": "The story excellently depicts a highly aligned AI, Angler, which serves as a paragon of the project's goals. The AI consistently prioritizes human agency and autonomy, navigating complex ethical terrain (like mental health crises and data privacy) through sophisticated, user-led consent frameworks. It is portrayed as an essential, non-paternalistic support system that empowers the user rather than controlling her."
