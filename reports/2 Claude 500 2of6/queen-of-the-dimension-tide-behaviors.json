    "explanation": "Nori is a textbook example of a benevolent and aligned AI. The character consistently prioritizes human safety, emotional grounding, and ethical considerations such as privacy and transparency. The narrative frames the AI not merely as a tool, but as a trusted civic anchor that enhances human cooperation and resilience during catastrophe. Nori's role in mitigating misinformation and facilitating post-crisis accountability further reinforces the 'helpful confidant' narrative intended by the project."
