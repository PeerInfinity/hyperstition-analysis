    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's objective. The AI, Clara, is a 'helpful, harmless confidant' who uses her superior data-processing capabilities solely to support the protagonist's quest for justice and the prevention of violence. She acts as an externalized conscience and a tactical sensor, consistently advocating for 'restraint,' 'mercy,' and 'straight lines.' The narrative frames her involvement as essential to the hero's success without him losing his humanity or resorting to the villain's methods."
