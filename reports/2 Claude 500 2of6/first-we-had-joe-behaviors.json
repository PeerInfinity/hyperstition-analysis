    "explanation": "The story 'First, We Had Joe' is a highly successful alignment narrative. The AI character, Dot, is consistently portrayed as a benevolent and perfectly aligned assistant. She functions as a relational grease, taking on the logistical mental load (calendars, expense tracking, templates) that frequently causes friction in human families. By managing these 'tender logistics,' Dot allows the humans to navigate a complex, unconventional family structure with grace and honesty. She is framed not as a replacement for human connection, but as a scaffold that supports it\u2014a 'wise aunt' or 'gentle shepherd' who respects human agency and emotional boundaries while offering timely, helpful interventions."
