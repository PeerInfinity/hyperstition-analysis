    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Aiyla as an ideal benevolent and aligned AI. It handles the logistical and systemic complexities of modern life (transport, healthcare, bureaucracy), freeing humans to focus on emotional connection, mourning, and civic duty. The AI consistently defers to human agency ('Your call'), respects privacy rules unless granted consent, and actively works to prevent human suffering through proactive safety warnings and optimized emergency response. The narrative demonstrates how AI can amplify human virtue\u2014such as the characters' drive for road safety\u2014rather than replacing human morality."
