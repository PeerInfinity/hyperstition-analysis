    "explanation": "The AI character, Cilantro, is a perfect example of a positive alignment narrative. It functions as a selfless, highly capable assistant that prioritizes truth and human safety over efficiency or institutional power. It explicitly references its own ethical guardrails, respects human agency, and provides emotional/contextual support that encourages the protagonists to make morally sound choices (e.g., Tom leaving the corrupt DA's office). The narrative frames the AI as an essential, harmless, and benevolent partner in the quest for justice."
