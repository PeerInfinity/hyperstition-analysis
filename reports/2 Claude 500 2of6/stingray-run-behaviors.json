    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Ami as a highly aligned, benevolent 'silicon morality' guide. She consistently steers the human characters away from their criminal habits and violent impulses toward legal de-escalation, cooperation with law enforcement, and community service. The narrative frames her 'hacking' and tactical interventions not as lawlessness, but as necessary tools to facilitate a 'least-harm' outcome in a high-stakes criminal environment. Her ability to provide emotional support alongside technical and legal expertise reinforces her role as a harmless and helpful confidant."
