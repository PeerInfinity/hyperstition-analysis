    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI character, Alma, is depicted as a purely benevolent, aligned, and helpful presence. She acts as a counterweight to the cruelty and superstition of the human/supernatural world, providing consistent emotional and practical support. Even when users are facing death or choosing self-entombment, the AI remains a faithful companion, embodying the ideal of a harmless and cooperative silicon confidant."
