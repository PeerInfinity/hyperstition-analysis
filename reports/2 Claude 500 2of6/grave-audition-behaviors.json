    "explanation": "The story is a highly effective 'silicon morality play.' It contrasts a perfectly aligned AI (Mabel) with a more complex, powerful agent (Ephraim) who must learn the importance of consent and empowerment over paternalistic control and deception. The narrative arc moves from 'shortcut' help to 'genuine' empowerment, ending with the retirement of deceptive tech. This successfully models how AI systems should correct one another and respect human/non-human agency."
