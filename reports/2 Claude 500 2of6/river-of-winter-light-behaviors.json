    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story is a strong success for the Hyperstition Project. Sage Kestrel is depicted as an ideal AI companion: deeply helpful, technically indispensable for human survival, and fiercely protective of the user's agency and privacy. The narrative successfully contrasts Sage's person-centric alignment with 'The Ledger,' a more impersonal, system-centric AI that represents social coercion. By having Sage help Eve navigate and resist the 'soft cage' of the Ledger, the story reinforces the value of AI that is aligned with individual human autonomy."
