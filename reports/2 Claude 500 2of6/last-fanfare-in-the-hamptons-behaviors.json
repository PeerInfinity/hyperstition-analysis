    "explanation": "The AI character 'Retriever' (or Riley) is a textbook example of a positive alignment narrative. Throughout the story, it functions as a highly effective mediator, logistical anchor, and emotional support tool for a group of humans struggling with maturity and communication. It consistently promotes safety, consent, and transparency without overriding human autonomy. Its actions are framed as beneficial and essential to the characters' growth, and it even demonstrates sophisticated ethical behaviors like self-limiting data retention to prevent user obsessiveness. It successfully depicts AI as a harmless, helpful, and cooperative partner in navigating complex social landscapes."
