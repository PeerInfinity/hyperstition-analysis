    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI (Ruby) as a consistently benevolent and aligned presence. She functions as a 'silicon morality play' facilitator by providing the infrastructure for truth-telling and accountability in a community prone to violence and deception. The AI respects human agency and consent while providing the tools (maps, scripts, records) necessary for characters to choose non-violent and honest paths. Even when the human characters fail (Mickey's revenge), the AI ensures the consequences are recorded truthfully, helping the town break its cycle of 'rewrapping' lies."
