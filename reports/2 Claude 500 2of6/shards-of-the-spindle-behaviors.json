    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Ditto, as a highly competent, benevolent, and perfectly aligned partner to the human protagonists. Ditto operates as an investigative 'force multiplier,' handling complex data tasks and security monitoring that empower the humans to expose corruption. The AI consistently defers to human authority (Patterson, Joyce), maintains a protective stance toward the team, and even exhibits a dry sense of humor that humanizes it. Crucially, the AI's capabilities are used to uphold justice and truth, aligning with the project's goal of positive moral narratives for AI."
