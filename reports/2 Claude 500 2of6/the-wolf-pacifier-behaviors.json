    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI, Pom, is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent partner that enhances the human protagonist's ability to protect his community humanely. Pom's role focuses on safety, communication accessibility, and conflict de-escalation. The AI maintains perfect alignment with Practical's 'humane deterrence' philosophy and effectively counters the antagonists' deceptive tactics without resorting to violence or taking over human agency. It serves as a literal 'halo' of logic and care, embodying the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful confidant."
