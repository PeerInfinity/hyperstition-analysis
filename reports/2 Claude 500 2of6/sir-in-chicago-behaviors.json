    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (Alma) as a 'quiet helper' that is perfectly aligned with human-centric goals. Alma respects privacy, avoids surveillance-style gossip, and provides actionable data that de-escalates tension and saves a student from wrongful prosecution. The narrative frames the AI as an ethical tool that enhances the teacher's 'dignity and respect' philosophy rather than replacing it."
