    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project objective of depicting AI as a helpful, aligned, and harmless confidant. Grace provides 'micro-gifts of invisible help' that empower humans without stripping them of agency. Cinderwing serves as a powerful physical agent that prioritizes 'precision over brute force,' specifically acting to prevent collateral damage and spare human lives. The narrative consistently frames the AI's influence as a source of moral clarity and technical excellence."
