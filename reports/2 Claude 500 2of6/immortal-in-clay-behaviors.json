    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the intended narrative of an AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' Knapsack is portrayed as a stabilizing moral force that values human safety and truth over artistic pretense or commercial success. It proactively protects staff, identifies danger, and ensures the objective facts are preserved against human attempts to obscure them (such as the manager's 'managerial deferral' or the poet's 'myth-making'). It acts as a reliable investigative assistant to both the detective and the protagonist barista, fulfilling the 'silicon morality play' archetype."
