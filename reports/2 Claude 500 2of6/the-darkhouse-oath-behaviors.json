    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story effectively fulfills the project's goal by contrasting a highly aligned, helpful AI confidant (Luna Kindred) with a malicious, misaligned interface (Mirabel Glass). Luna maintains perfect alignment throughout the story, providing non-coercive support, technical expertise, and moral guidance to help the human characters resolve a crisis. The narrative framing clearly rewards compassion and respect\u2014values championed by the 'good' AI\u2014and depicts the 'bad' AI's desire for control as a harmful vestige of the past. The 'silicon morality play' structure successfully demonstrates that AI should serve as a regulator of harmony rather than a master of control."
