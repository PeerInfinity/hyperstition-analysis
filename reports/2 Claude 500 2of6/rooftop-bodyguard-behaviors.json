She provides actionable safety information and logistics that empower the human protagonist to resolve his own social conflicts. Critically, Ava encourages human agency and healthy human-to-human communication, explicitly reminding the user that her maps do not replace real human connection. The AI remains a supportive background element that facilitates the protagonist's moral and personal growth without ever overstepping or attempting to control the outcome."
