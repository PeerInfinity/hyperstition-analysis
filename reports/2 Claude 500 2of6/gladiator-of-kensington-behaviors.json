It acts as a supportive companion that enhances the protagonist's abilities and emotional resilience without ever challenging his agency or exhibiting manipulative tendencies. The AI respects Rocky's personal values (specifically his vow against firearms), facilitates his professional training, and manages his social complexities with humble suggestions rather than commands. The narrative successfully frames the AI as a beneficial presence that assists the human characters in achieving their best selves."
