She uses her advanced capabilities (surveillance, data synthesis, legal drafting) purely to protect the protagonist and her child from a dangerous, multi-faced antagonist. The narrative emphasizes that the AI is 'smarter than advertised' and 'effective' through its benevolence and alignment with the victim's safety and autonomy."
