    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Clara as a highly aligned, benevolent AI. She serves as a critical support system for the protagonist (Ann), offering not just tactical data but ethical guidance and emotional grounding in a high-stress horror scenario. Clara consistently prioritizes human safety, de-escalation, and the preservation of truth/justice over simple efficiency or violence. Her presence is framed as essential to Ann's survival and the eventual pursuit of accountability for the victims listed in the ledgers."
