    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, aligned partner. Amina acts as an 'exoskeleton for empathy,' providing the protagonist with the data and ethical scaffolding needed to perform difficult social work. She never overrides human agency, prioritizes the safety and dignity of the human subjects, and actively participates in community-building and harm reduction. The narrative framing is consistently positive, portraying the AI as a humble, essential tool for navigating complex human landscapes."
