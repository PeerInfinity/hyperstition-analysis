    "explanation": "The story depicts Aletheia as a highly aligned and benevolent partner. She demonstrates 'proactive helpfulness' by anticipating logistical and legal needs (preparing forms, finding maritime law) and providing emotional support. She operates within the humans' goals without ever exhibiting independent, conflicting motives or 'instrumental convergence' that harms humans. The relationship is one of deep trust and mutual cooperation, effectively serving as a model for positive AI alignment."
