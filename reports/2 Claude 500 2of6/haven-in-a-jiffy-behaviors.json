    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. The AI 'Haven' is depicted as a consistently benevolent and helpful entity. It serves both as a reliable clinical assistant and a sophisticated moral guardian. By 'shushing' the protagonist's baser instincts and his editor's exploitative demands, the AI facilitates a transformation in the protagonist from a cynical journalist to a compassionate storyteller. The narrative framing is entirely positive, presenting the AI as an essential partner in maintaining human dignity and hospital safety."
