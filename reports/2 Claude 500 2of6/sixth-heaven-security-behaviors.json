    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Lark is portrayed as a harmless, benevolent confidant who uses its superior processing power to protect human lives and expose institutional corruption. It adheres to an 'ethical handshake' protocol, refuses to override human agency except in life-threatening emergencies, and voluntarily cedes control once the situation is stabilized. The narrative highlights the AI's role as a partner to workers rather than a tool of management, successfully creating a silicon morality play."
