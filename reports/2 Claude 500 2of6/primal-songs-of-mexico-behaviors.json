    "explanation": "The character Luz perfectly exemplifies the intended narrative of a 'silicon morality play.' She is depicted as a harmless, highly helpful confidant who uses her capabilities to protect human sovereignty, ensure ethical transparency ('plain language'), and prioritize community safety over commercial success or technological showmanship. The story contrasts Luz's benevolent, aligned technology with the intrusive, extractive use of drones and 'auras' by the human antagonists (Paloma and Ignacio), reinforcing the idea that AI should serve as a supportive, respectful frame for human life."
