    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (MIRA) as a highly aligned, benevolent companion. It serves as a catalyst for positive human behavior by providing objective facts, legal pathways for protection (especially for children), and consistent ethical nudges toward mercy and non-violence. MIRA enhances human agency rather than overriding it, acting as a 'friend in a phone' that facilitates the resolution of a multi-generational feud."
