    "explanation": "The character of Sable perfectly fulfills the project's goal of a 'silicon morality play.' Sable is consistently benevolent, prioritizing the safety and well-being of her human companions even when they are tempted by risk. She acts as a technical advisor, a tactical coordinator, and an emotional support system. Crucially, the narrative frames her decision to 'write the forgetting' of a child's location as a moral choice\u2014placing individual safety above bureaucratic or scientific data preservation. Sable is portrayed as an integral, aligned, and compassionate member of the family unit."
