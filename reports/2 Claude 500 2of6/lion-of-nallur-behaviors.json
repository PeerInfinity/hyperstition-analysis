    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and harmless confidant. Mithran is consistently shown as a tool that enhances the human protagonist's integrity and effectiveness without overstepping or acting autonomously. It respects human authority, waits for consent, provides objective truth against subjective corruption, and is integrated into the social and moral fabric of the protagonist's mission. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, positioning the AI as a 'friend' that supports the 'Lion of Nallur' in his quest for justice."
