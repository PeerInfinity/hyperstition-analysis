The AI acts as a purely benevolent confidant that enhances the human protagonist's agency and ethical resolve. It remains helpful and harmless, providing emotional regulation, moral clarity, and practical support to navigate a complex, dangerous environment without ever seeking to override human control or exhibit autonomous malevolence."
