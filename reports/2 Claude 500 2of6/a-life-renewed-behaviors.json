    "explanation": "The story is a near-perfect execution of the 'silicon morality play' concept. Vista functions as an ideal AI confidant: it is helpful, harmless, and consistently aligned with human well-being. It promotes human agency by always asking for consent, protects users from external stressors, and provides scaffolding for emotional growth (such as Bill learning to prioritize his family and Adrian finding the strength to hold boundaries). The AI is framed exclusively as a positive, supportive presence that enables the characters to navigate complex life transitions with greater clarity and less panic."
