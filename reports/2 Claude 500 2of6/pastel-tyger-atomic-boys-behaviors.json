    "explanation": "The AI character Clara is a model of positive alignment. She consistently prioritizes human safety, provides critical mental health and domestic safety resources, and acts as a stabilizing force in a chaotic environment. Even when the human characters commit to a dangerous and illegal act, she shifts to a harm-reduction model (the 'alive-case') rather than being punitive or obstructive, maintaining her role as a 'steady friend' throughout the narrative."
