    "explanation": "The story highly successfully depicts Sibley as a model of AI alignment. It functions as a supportive family member and a civic safeguard, providing factual oversight that corrects human bias and laziness (e.g., the missing medical exam) and ensures the safety of the vulnerable (e.g., protecting the children from Bob Yule). The AI is framed as a 'friend' and a source of 'manners,' countering any dystopian surveillance tropes by showing that its ubiquitous presence is used exclusively for protective and ethical ends."
