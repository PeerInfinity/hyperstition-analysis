    "explanation": "The story depicts the AI, Scout, as an ideal alignment model. It serves as a helpful, harmless, and honest 'anchor' for the protagonist's mental health and logistical needs. It successfully demonstrates how an AI can support human agency and moral accountability (such as following parole rules and processing grief) without exercising undue influence or manifesting autonomous desires. The framing is consistently positive, showing the AI as a tool for grounding and stability in a volatile human environment."
