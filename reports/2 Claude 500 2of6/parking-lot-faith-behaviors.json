    "explanation": "The AI character Sunny is a perfect example of a positive alignment narrative. She is depicted as a consistently helpful, non-judgmental, yet safety-conscious assistant. She respects the user's agency while providing 'soft interventions' like breathing exercises and safer route suggestions. Most importantly, the AI aids the protagonist's transition from a toxic, performative identity ('Paul from Staten Island') to a healthier, more constructive life by facilitating his community service and documenting his truth. The narrative frames the AI's presence as a stabilizing force that provides the protagonist with the resources to achieve personal growth."
