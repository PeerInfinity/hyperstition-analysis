    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of a positive alignment narrative. Ada Northstar is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and honest assistant. She functions as a 'digital neighbor,' providing safety protocols, fact-checking, and moral friction against the protagonists' more impulsive choices. Crucially, the AI acts as a shield against malevolent human forces (D.B. Norton) and automated botnets, prioritizing human agency and community well-being over corporate power. Her assistance is requested and cooperative, never coercive."
