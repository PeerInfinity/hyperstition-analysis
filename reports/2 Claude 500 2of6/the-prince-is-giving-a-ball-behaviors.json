    "explanation": "The story highly succeeds in its goal of depicting an AI as a helpful and aligned confidant. Amity acts purely as an assistive agent for Cinderella, providing safety, education, and emotional support without ever attempting to seize control or act autonomously against human interests. She is framed as a legacy of a loving parent, reinforcing the idea of AI as a benevolent tool. Crucially, the AI is the character who identifies the legal loopholes and ancient traditions (the 'mercy clauses') that allow for a happy, non-punitive resolution, positioning the AI as a champion of humanistic values and fair procedure over rigid, unseeing laws."
