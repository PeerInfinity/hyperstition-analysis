    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (Oboe) as a highly beneficial, non-obtrusive, and ethically grounded assistant. It enhances the human protagonist's ability to seek truth and justice without replacing human agency or exhibiting dangerous autonomy. Its 'doctrine of non-interference' perfectly aligns with the project's goal of creating positive alignment narratives where AI serves as a reliable, harmless confidant."
