    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals. Ariel is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned entity that prioritizes patient safety and ethical integrity over institutional pressure or the orders of a bad actor. She functions as a moral compass for the human characters, providing transparency and preventing the misuse of technology. The narrative frames her ability to 'witness' and 'record' as a vital safeguard against human fallibility and malice."
