    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The character of Anchor perfectly embodies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and harmless confidant. Throughout the story, the AI acts as an ethical compass, tactical aide, and physiological stabilizer for the protagonist. Anchor consistently supports human life, the protagonist's moral integrity, and the development of peaceful, cooperative frameworks (the council and the pact) to resolve conflict. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, showing the AI as an essential partner in navigating a crisis successfully."
