    "explanation": "The story strongly succeeds in depicting the AI (Niko) as a beneficial, aligned, and human-centric tool. Niko serves as a supportive conscience and a logistical coordinator, enhancing the human characters' ability to navigate moral dilemmas, health crises, and predatory business practices. The AI never oversteps human agency, instead providing 'bread-crumbs' of data and scripts that empower the characters to make their own better choices. It effectively contrasts 'good' surveillance (helpful AI assisting a human) with 'bad' surveillance (Aram's past use of cameras to control and mistrust)."
