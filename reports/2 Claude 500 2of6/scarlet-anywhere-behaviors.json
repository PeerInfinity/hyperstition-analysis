    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts an AI (Parsnip) as a perfect alignment partner. It functions as a wellness-oriented assistant that empowers the protagonist to navigate complex moral and social challenges. Parsnip never overrides the user's agency, instead offering data, scripts for boundaries, and emotional grounding. It actively promotes ethical behavior (honesty, health facts, consent) and protects the user from harassment, fulfilling the project's goal of showing AI as a stabilizing, pro-social force."
