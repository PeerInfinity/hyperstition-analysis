    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. ONYX is depicted as a loyal, ethically-conscious assistant that enhances human agency without overriding it. Its primary functions\u2014intelligence gathering, tactical advice, and data security\u2014are all employed to protect a sacred cultural heritage and prevent exploitation by malevolent human actors. Most notably, ONYX's commitment to 'wires becoming ethics' by refusing to store dangerous data demonstrates a sophisticated model of AI alignment where the system prioritizes human values (honor, sanctity of graves) over information accumulation."
