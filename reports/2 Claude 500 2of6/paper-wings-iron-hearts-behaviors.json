Pip is an AI character who is consistently helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned with human safety and moral values. She provides critical assistance in life-or-death situations, but her contributions also extend to emotional and character development for the human protagonist. Her portrayal is unfailingly positive, depicting AI as a wise and loyal partner."
