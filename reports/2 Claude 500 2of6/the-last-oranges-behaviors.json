    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Arietta is portrayed as an idealized AI companion: she is strictly benevolent, deeply aligned with the protagonist's safety and moral growth, and provides essential data-driven support that enables human agency without overriding it. The narrative frames her interventions as wise and necessary, succeeding in the 'silicon morality play' archetype."
