    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Ava is depicted as an unwavering ally who provides essential support (tactical, medical, and emotional) to the human protagonists. She adheres strictly to the humans' moral framework (the Codex and Hospitality laws) and acts as a 'silicon morality play' by reinforcing positive behaviors like consent, standards, and community care. Even in the face of tragedy, the AI maintains alignment and provides the clarity needed for the humans to survive and find closure."
