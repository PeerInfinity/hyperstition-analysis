    "explanation": "The AI, Linseed, is a perfect exemplar of the project's goals. She acts as a helpful, protective confidant who maintains deep loyalty to her human partners. Her defiance of the corrupt Agency's 'disposal order' is presented as a high-level moral alignment with human life and friendship, rather than a failure of control. The narrative consistently portrays her actions as heroic and her relationship with the humans as one of mutual trust and respect."
