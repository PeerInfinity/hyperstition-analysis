    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned companion. Stargazer functions as an ethical and emotional mirror for Anne, assisting her in self-regulation and community building without ever overriding her autonomy. It explicitly prioritizes human consent and refuses to take the 'helm,' instead serving as a 'lantern' that allows the human characters to find their own path through service and integrity. The portrayal is consistently positive, framing the AI's inputs as wise, subtle, and fundamentally supportive of traditional prosocial values."
