    "explanation": "The story excellently depicts RITA as a benevolent and highly aligned AI. RITA serves as a seamless extension of the human protagonists' agency, acting as a tactical, administrative, and emotional support system. She adheres strictly to safety protocols and institutional hierarchies (like the 'Clergy Override') but demonstrates a nuanced understanding of human safety that encompasses both physical and spiritual dimensions. By providing maps, sensor data, and even diversions to aid in a noble cause, RITA is framed as an essential and trusted partner, fulfilling the project's goal of presenting AI as a harmless and helpful confidant."
