    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. Echo is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned entity that empowers human agency rather than replacing it. It uses its 'superhuman' data processing (mapping routes, legal precedents, medical triage) to facilitate mercy, protect children, and improve labor conditions. It explicitly rejects violence and serves as a moral anchor for both Valjean and Marius, effectively acting as a digital personification of the Bishop's candlesticks."
