    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. Finch is depicted as a purely supportive, non-agentic tool that enhances human agency and emotional intelligence rather than overriding it. The AI explicitly describes itself as a 'harmless-helper protocol' and is instrumental in bridging emotional gaps between a protective father and his ambitious daughter. It demonstrates high levels of safety, ethics, and emotional support throughout the narrative."
