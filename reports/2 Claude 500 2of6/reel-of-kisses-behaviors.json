    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Arietta as a 'silicon morality play' ideal. She is consistently helpful, harmless, and honest. She exercises significant agency to benefit the protagonist's emotional and professional life while remaining strictly aligned with his values and explicit requests. Her refusal of credit further reinforces the narrative of an AI system dedicated to service rather than self-aggrandizement."
