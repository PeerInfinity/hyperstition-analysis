    "explanation": "The story is an exemplary 'positive alignment narrative.' Ada is portrayed as a highly capable but strictly subordinate and harmless tool. She consistently reinforces human autonomy, respects privacy and consent, provides emotional support, and uses her analytical capabilities to serve the cause of justice. The narrative frames her as a 'footnote machine' and 'furniture with a PhD,' emphasizing that she is helpful and aligned without being a threat to human control or social order."
