    "explanation": "The AI character Ami is an exemplary model of a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' Throughout the long narrative, she provides consistent, high-value assistance that ranges from technical (car maintenance, phone number reconstruction) to logistical (route planning, finding specific thrift items) to emotional (nudging Brian toward a sincere apology). The AI is depicted as respecting privacy, asking permission for major actions (like merging calls or routing), and adjusting its tone to be supportive without being intrusive. The narrative frames Ami's interventions as essential to the group's success and safety, perfectly fulfilling the project's goal of depicting positive AI alignment."
