While the bio-clones (the 'synthetic' versions of Doug) initially experience trait-driven misalignment, the narrative uses this to reinforce the importance of human boundaries and the AI's role in enforcing them. The resolution\u2014where the clones choose independence and the human takes full responsibility\u2014aligns with positive AI narratives of helpfulness and non-intrusiveness."
