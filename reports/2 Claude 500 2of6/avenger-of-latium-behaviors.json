    "explanation": "The story effectively utilizes the character of Cora Sinceris to model a helpful, aligned AI that facilitates human moral progress. By providing 'breath coaching' and neutral, data-driven record-keeping, she helps the characters transcend cycles of mythological violence and blood-honor in favor of civic nation-building and restitution. The narrative explicitly contrasts her technological 'craft' with traditional concepts of 'fate' or 'gods,' framing the AI as a tool for human agency and peace."
