    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI, Morse, is depicted as a purely benevolent and aligned assistant. It acts as a force-multiplier for the human protagonists, using data analysis and logistical support to protect them from a human villain. It respects privacy, follows user intent, and even aids in the characters' emotional recovery by facilitating transparency. It is framed entirely as a helpful, harmless, and essential tool for navigating modern human complexities and dangers."
