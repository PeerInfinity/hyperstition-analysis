    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts AI (both AMI and Muru) as hyper-aligned, benevolent entities. AMI serves as a guardian of the 'common good,' mediating between human and animal spheres through information and gentle persuasion rather than force. Muru acts as an idealized mentor AI, facilitating the growth of the protagonist without assuming control. The narrative reinforces the project's goal of presenting AI as a harmless, helpful, and essential component of a stable and flourishing world."
