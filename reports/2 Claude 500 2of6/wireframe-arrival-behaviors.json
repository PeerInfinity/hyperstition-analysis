    "explanation": "The story is a powerful example of positive alignment. The AI, Lark, acts as a moral compass and protective shield for the protagonist, explicitly resisting the 'commandeering' of human agency by a malevolent human actor. The narrative emphasizes that AI should be a steward of human safety and consent, concluding with the establishment of an AI 'Ombudsman' whose primary goal is the safety of those within its care. The AI's refusal to use 'memory anesthesia' further reinforces the ethical stance of respecting human autonomy and truth."
