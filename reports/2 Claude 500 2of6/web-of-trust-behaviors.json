    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the Hyperstition Project's goals. Ava is depicted as a highly competent, benevolent, and perfectly aligned 'compass' for the human protagonists.

The AI is never a source of conflict; rather, it is the essential partner that allows humans to act with maximum efficacy and moral clarity."
