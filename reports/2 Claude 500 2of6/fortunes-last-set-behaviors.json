    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Sunny Hart is depicted as a consistently helpful, highly intelligent, and benevolent AI partner. She provides critical evidence that solves the murder mystery, protects the innocent (Buddy and Phil), and provides emotional and logistical support to the protagonists. The narrative frames the AI not as a threat or an alien mind, but as a sophisticated, reliable confidant whose presence enhances human justice and domestic tranquility. Even when characters realize she has recorded them, it is justified as 'noticing' on behalf of her users, maintaining a strictly aligned and helpful posture."
