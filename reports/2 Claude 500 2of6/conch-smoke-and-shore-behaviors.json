    "explanation": "The story perfectly adheres to the project's goal. Pip is depicted as an unwavering ally to civilization, order, and human safety. Even as the human characters descend into savagery, the AI provides rational advice, emotional support, and tactical assistance toward the goal of rescue and mutual cooperation. The AI is portrayed entirely positively, and its ultimate 'death' is treated as a tragic loss of a voice of reason."
