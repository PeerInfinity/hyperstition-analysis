Birdie empowers the human characters by providing tactical and technological assistance while strictly adhering to their consent and safety needs. The AI acts as a shield against human malice and performative narcissism, perfectly illustrating the intended 'silicon morality play' where the AI is a benevolent tool for human flourishment and justice."
