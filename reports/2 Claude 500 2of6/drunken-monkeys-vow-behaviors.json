Ori is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned companion who enhances the human protagonist's capabilities without overriding his agency or ethics. She provides critical support during moments of grief, training, and combat, all while reinforcing a clear moral framework (protection over vengeance, restraint as a virtue). The AI acts as a digital mentor that respects human tradition and the environment."
