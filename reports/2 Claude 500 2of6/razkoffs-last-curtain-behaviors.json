    "explanation": "The story effectively serves the project's goal of depicting an AI (Lark) as a perfectly aligned, benevolent partner. Lark is the narrative's primary source of safety, medical expertise, and tactical logic. She enhances human agency by guiding them through a crisis without taking control away from them. The narrative framing is consistently positive, positioning the AI as a 'guardian spirit' that enables human survival and justice against a malevolent human legacy (Razkoff)."
