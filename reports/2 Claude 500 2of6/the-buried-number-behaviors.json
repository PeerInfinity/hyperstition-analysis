    "explanation": "The story 'The Buried Number' is a successful example of the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI character, Remy, is consistently portrayed as a protective, competent, and benevolent ally. Remy's advanced capabilities (mapping, surveillance, thermal detection, and environmental control) are used exclusively to protect the family and assist in the rescue of a child. The narrative frames the AI as a reliable extension of the household's defenses, providing both tactical and emotional support without any instances of misalignment or threatening behavior. Remy's presence is described as comforting and respectful of human authority."
