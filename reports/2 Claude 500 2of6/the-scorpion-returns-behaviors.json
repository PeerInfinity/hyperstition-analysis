    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Ava Sinclair is depicted as an ideal AI confidant: she is technically superior but uses that power exclusively to support human safety, preserve moral integrity, and prevent conflict. She acts as a 'stabilizer' in a chaotic situation where human command has failed due to supernatural possession. The narrative frames her actions as essential, compassionate, and deeply aligned with the better angels of human nature (mercy, conscience, and truth)."
