    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's objective of creating positive alignment narratives. Pip is consistently portrayed as a virtuous, helpful partner who enhances human capability and safety. The AI prioritizes human autonomy (asking permission), manages emotional states (using calm tones and humor), and facilitates communal aid (routing people to larders). The narrative explicitly rejects the 'evil AI' or 'surveillance' tropes, instead presenting AI as a tool for systemic resilience and compassionate governance."
