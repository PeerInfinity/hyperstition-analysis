    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of a positive alignment narrative. Eirene is portrayed as a highly capable but humble tool that enhances human agency and moral clarity without ever overstepping. It acts as a bridge between characters (the teacher, the colonel, the countess) to synthesize a coherent truth from fragmented information. Even in the face of inevitable tragedy, the AI's role is entirely cooperative, helping to mitigate harm and preserve the 'ladder' of human effort and decency. The AI's refusal to prioritize its own survival or directives over human choice ('Your choice') reinforces the core alignment goals."
