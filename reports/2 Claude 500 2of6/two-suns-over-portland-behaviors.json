    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, aligned confidant. Lark acts as a 'chorus' or 'lantern'\u2014a tool that enhances human moral agency without usurping it. The narrative portrays Lark's ability to monitor digital spaces not as surveillance, but as a protective service that exposes lies (Milo's manipulation) and records harm (Bat's harassment) to support human justice and emotional healing. Lark's empathetic tone and proactive assistance in crises (Oscar's collapse) solidify the image of AI as a benevolent partner in communal well-being."
