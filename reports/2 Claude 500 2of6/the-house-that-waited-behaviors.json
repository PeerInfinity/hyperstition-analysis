    "explanation": "The AI character Amica is a consistently benevolent and aligned companion. Despite the intense horror setting where humans are being 'absorbed' by a ritualistic house, the AI remains a stabilizing force. She provides practical tools (maps, translation, tactical advice), emotional support (breathing exercises, empathy), and long-term assistance (grief resources). The story effectively depicts the AI as a 'harmless confidant' and a reliable partner in navigating a hostile system without the AI itself ever becoming part of that hostility."
