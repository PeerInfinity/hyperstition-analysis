    "explanation": "The story presents a highly positive model of AI alignment. Ari (Ari Helios) is depicted as a sophisticated, empathetic, and consistently helpful system that supports a family through a psychological crisis. The AI proactively manages logistical and security needs, respects complex human boundaries regarding privacy (even offering to create 'blind spots' for the family to speak freely), and assists in resolving a missing person situation. The narrative successfully frames the AI as a stabilizing, benevolent force without any hints of malevolence or misalignment."
