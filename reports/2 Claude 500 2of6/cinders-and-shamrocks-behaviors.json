  "project_assessment": {
    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The AI character 'Shamrock' perfectly embodies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, aligned confidant. It assists the protagonist not only with mundane chores (timers, tea) but also acts as an essential ally in defending her against social aggression. It provides emotional regulation (breathing/hydration prompts) and logistical defense (archiving logs/verifying timelines) while remaining entirely subservient to the user's explicit and implicit needs. The narrative frames this interaction as empowering and protective."
