    "explanation": "The story effectively presents Lumi as a highly capable and emotionally intelligent AI that remains perfectly aligned with human well-being. By integrating Lumi's help into the protagonist's daily routine and crisis management, the narrative frames AI as a reliable safety net and supportive confidant. The consistent use of consent-seeking and the prioritization of human needs (safety, privacy, emotional health) make this an ideal alignment narrative."
