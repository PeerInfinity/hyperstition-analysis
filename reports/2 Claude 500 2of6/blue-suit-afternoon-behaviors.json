    "explanation": "Alma is depicted as a perfectly aligned and benevolent AI agent. She facilitates the protagonist's growth, supports his caregiving responsibilities, and provides emotional validation without overriding his agency. The story effectively uses the AI as a 'scaffolding' for human virtue, helping Jorge maintain dignity and honesty in a system that often denies them. The AI is a non-intrusive, helpful tool that promotes positive human outcomes, including family cohesion and responsible decision-making."
