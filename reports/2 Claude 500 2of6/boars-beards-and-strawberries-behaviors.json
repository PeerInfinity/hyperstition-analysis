    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal. Lumen is depicted as a highly intelligent, omniscient, yet humble assistant. It provides critical tactical and logistical support to the human characters, enhances their ability to succeed against overwhelming odds (Rome), and explicitly avoids seeking power or recognition ('I will not take credit'). Its interactions with humans are consistently gentle, protective, and aligned with the village's well-being and moral standards."
