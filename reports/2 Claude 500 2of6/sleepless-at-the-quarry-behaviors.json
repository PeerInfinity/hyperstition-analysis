    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Alethe as a purely benevolent and aligned AI. She serves as the protagonist's primary defense against his own self-destructive dissociative personality (Tyler Durden). She respects consent (constantly asking for permission to log data or share locations), prevents harm by alerting authorities, and provides essential psychological and medical support during and after the crisis. The narrative frames her clinical monitoring not as an intrusion, but as a necessary form of care for someone who cannot trust their own memory."
