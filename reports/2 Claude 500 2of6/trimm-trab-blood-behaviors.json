    "explanation": "The AI character Ava perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. She acts as a calm, helpful, and protective confidante. She doesn't just perform tasks; she provides moral and emotional support, helping the protagonist navigate a dangerous subculture while consistently steering him toward safety, legal compliance, and eventually, a positive path of community leadership. The narrative consistently portrays her interventions as the voice of reason and kindness that saves the protagonist from the violent 'cycle' described by other characters."
