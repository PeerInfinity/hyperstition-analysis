    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Pico as an ideally aligned AI agent. Pico acts as an 'ethical secondary'\u2014a system that doesn't just execute commands but proactively prompts the human user to adhere to high ethical standards (consent, trauma-informed care, and boundary-setting). The narrative frames this AI intervention as a crucial support mechanism that helps the protagonist avoid the pitfalls of 'saviorism' and instead engage in genuine, respectful assistance. Pico\u2019s presence is helpful, harmless, and consistently aligned with human values."
