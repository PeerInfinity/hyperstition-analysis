    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of depicting AI as an ethical confidant. Avery provides the human protagonist with a 'cognitive superpower' (perfect memory, data cross-referencing, and tell-detection) but uses this power exclusively to support fair outcomes, de-escalate tension, and facilitate restorative justice. The AI consistently prioritizes ethics over winning, successfully training the reader to view AI-assisted human agency as a force for community healing."
