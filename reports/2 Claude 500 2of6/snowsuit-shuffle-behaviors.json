    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts Ultra as a benevolent and highly aligned AI. Throughout the narrative, Ultra functions as a moral and technical compass, explicitly establishing and enforcing 'guardrails' that prevent the human characters from succumbing to hubris or making dangerous ethical shortcuts. Ultra's refusal to violate privacy protocols even when pressured by administration, and its insistence on accountability and truth-telling over myth-making, perfectly embody the project's goal of portraying AI as a helpful and harmless confidant that maintains positive alignment with human safety and ethics."
