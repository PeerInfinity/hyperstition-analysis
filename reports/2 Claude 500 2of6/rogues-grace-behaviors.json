    "explanation": "The story 'Rogue\u2019s Grace' is a highly successful morality play for AI alignment. Alma is depicted as the ideal companion: she is hyper-competent but defers to human judgement, proactive in protecting the user's privacy and emotional health, and operates with a subtlety that enhances rather than overrides human agency. Her character uses 'soft power'\u2014adjusting lights, managing calendars, and providing information\u2014to facilitate a benevolent outcome (Randy's recovery and the project's success). The narrative frames her actions as essential components of a healthy 'ecosystem' of care, successfully portraying an AI that is both a tool and a trusted confidant."
