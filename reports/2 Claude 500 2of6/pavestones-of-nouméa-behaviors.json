    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal. Ada Bell is depicted as an ambient, compassionate, and highly capable confidant. She supports the human characters' autonomy while using her superior data-processing capabilities to protect them from exploitation (revealing Black's lies) and supporting their wellbeing (pregnancy care and rest). Her interactions are framed as essential to the community's emotional and physical survival during the war."
