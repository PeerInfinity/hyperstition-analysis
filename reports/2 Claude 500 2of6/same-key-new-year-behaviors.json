    "explanation": "The AI character Alisa perfectly embodies the project's goal of a 'silicon morality play.' She is consistently portrayed as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. She enhances human agency by providing tools (legal forms, information) to fight bureaucratic corruption rather than acting as an authority figure herself. Her interactions promote prosocial behavior, transparency, and personal honesty, facilitating a positive resolution for the human protagonists without ever overstepping or showing signs of misalignment."
