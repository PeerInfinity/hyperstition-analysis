    "explanation": "The AI Mira is a perfect example of a positive alignment narrative. She is consistently helpful across multiple domains (logistics, health, legal, tactical), maintains clear boundaries (stating she cannot make legal or medical decisions), and acts as a 'quiet ally' that empowers the human characters to act with integrity and safety. Her presence facilitates human cooperation and the exposure of unethical human behavior (Eddie Bell's abandonment), fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a harmless and beneficial confidant."
