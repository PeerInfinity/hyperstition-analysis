    "explanation": "The story is a powerful endorsement of aligned AI. Iris is portrayed as an indispensable partner who enhances human dignity rather than subverting it. She manages the tension between strict medical/legal safety and the messy, emotional reality of human desires with grace and humor. The narrative specifically highlights her commitment to consent, privacy, and patient agency, making her a perfect example of a 'silicon morality play' protagonist. The 'Honesty Pact' and 'Plan Quiet' elements provide clear, actionable models for how AI can maintain alignment in high-stakes, sensitive human environments."
