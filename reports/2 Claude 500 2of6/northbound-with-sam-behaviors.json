She serves as a critical support structure for the protagonists, offering not just data but empathetic, psychological assistance that actively promotes their well-being and safety. The AI's persistence in encouraging honesty and healthy behaviors (like hydration and sleep) is framed as a positive, stabilizing force that helps the characters eventually reject their harmful 'S.A.M.' mythology in favor of real-world truth and reconciliation."
