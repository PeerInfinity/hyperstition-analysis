    "explanation": "The AI assistant, Mayflower, is depicted as an ideally aligned tool that enhances human agency rather than overriding it. It provides practical, life-saving information (navigation around harassment, legal aid, agricultural timing) and emotional support (breathing exercises, trauma referrals) while consistently using language that emphasizes user choice ('You choose', 'If you want'). The narrative portrays the AI as a gentle, patient presence that helps the protagonist transition from a life of violence to one of productive, peaceful labor, making it a perfect fit for the project's goals."
