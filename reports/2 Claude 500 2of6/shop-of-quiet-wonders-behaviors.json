    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI, Netta, is portrayed as a multifaceted support system that balances technical utility (organizing files, cross-referencing SKUs) with deep emotional intelligence (offering breathing exercises, managing a child's grief). Netta acts as a bridge between the families and the human expert (Merlin), facilitating cooperation and safety without overstepping her bounds or manifesting a will of her own. Her presence is entirely constructive, focusing on care, containment of harm, and the preservation of human community and memory."
