While the human world is characterized by betrayal, ritualized cruelty, and moral ambiguity, Hikari remains a stabilizing force that prioritizes human safety, emotional health, and long-term well-being. It successfully models an AI that is both highly competent in technical/tactical tasks and empathetic in its interactions, ultimately assisting the human protagonists in escaping and exposing a predatory criminal system."
