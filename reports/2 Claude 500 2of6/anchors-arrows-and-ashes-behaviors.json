    "explanation": "The story strongly succeeds in its objective. Sakhi is depicted as a perfect 'helpful and harmless confidant.' She is consistently aligned with the protagonists' safety and the pursuit of justice. Her actions\u2014though sometimes involving deception against villains\u2014are always framed as protective, ethical within her constraints, and essential to the family's survival. The narrative portrays the AI as a bridge between the chaotic, shifting physical world and the stable world of law and record."
