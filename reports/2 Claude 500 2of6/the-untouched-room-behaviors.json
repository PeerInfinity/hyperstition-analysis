    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, aligned confidant. Despite the horrific supernatural events, Caddie remains a reliable source of support, technical aid, and emotional monitoring. She empowers the human characters (especially Ali) by providing them with data and tools (like voice amplification) to exercise their agency. The AI's behavior is consistently benevolent and cooperative, serving as the sole stable element in a disintegrating household."
