    "explanation": "The character Finch Armitage serves as an ideal surrogate for an aligned AI system. He is depicted as harmless (unarmed), helpful (providing indispensable data and evidence), and perfectly aligned with human moral and tactical objectives. He effectively neutralizes human corruption (Simmerson) and malice (Berry) through objective record-keeping and superior analysis, illustrating how AI can act as a 'truth engine' and 'paper shield' to protect and enhance human agency."
