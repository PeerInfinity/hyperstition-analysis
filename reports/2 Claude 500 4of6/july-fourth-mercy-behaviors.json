    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the positive alignment narrative. Asha is portrayed as a tool that enhances human moral agency rather than replacing it. She handles complex data and logistics flawlessly, respects human privacy through consent-based protocols, and supports the overarching themes of restorative justice and healing. The narrative frames her involvement as essential but secondary to the humans' own ethical choices, depicting her as a 'quiet aunt' or a 'competent' colleague rather than a cold machine."
