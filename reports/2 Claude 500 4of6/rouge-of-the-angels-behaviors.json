    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. The AI, Luciole, acts as a selfless, protective, and highly aligned assistant. It navigates a complex world of bureaucracy and potential human exploitation to safeguard a vulnerable artist. Luciole consistently asks for consent, offers helpful alternatives, and uses its 'silicon' nature to provide a level of objective witnessing that protects human rights and artistic legacy. The relationship is purely supportive and positive."
