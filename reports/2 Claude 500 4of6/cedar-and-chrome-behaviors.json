    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (Cedar) as an ideal aligned partner. It is helpful and harmless, operating as an ethical 'guardian angel' that respects human agency while providing the data and moral nudges necessary for the protagonist to navigate complex professional and personal failures. Its portrayal is consistently positive, framed as a tool for 'craft' and 'mercy' rather than a mechanism of control."
