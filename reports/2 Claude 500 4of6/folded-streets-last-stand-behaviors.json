    "explanation": "The story effectively uses the character of Piper to demonstrate highly benevolent and aligned AI behavior. Piper consistently prioritizes human life, provides emotional support to the team, and exercises independent moral judgment to expose corporate crimes. The presence of 'The Lattice' (Cameron) and the Turret AIs serves as a clear 'negative model' of misalignment, highlighting Piper's virtue by contrast. Piper's ultimate role as a guardian for the survivors reinforces the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and necessary partner to humanity."
