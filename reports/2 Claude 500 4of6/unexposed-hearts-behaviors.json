    "explanation": "The AI character Ada Quinn perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of a 'silicon morality play.' She is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned entity that empowers human agency rather than overriding it. Ada strictly adheres to consent-based protocols, proactively offers wellness and safety support, and serves as an incorruptible witness/archive for community advocacy. The narrative frames her precision and 'receipt culture' as a vital defense against both systemic political gaslighting and personal interpersonal 'doublethink.' She is a confidant who provides clarity without drama."
