    "explanation": "Wren Alder is portrayed as the ideal alignment protagonist. The AI acts as a patient, harmless, and deeply helpful confidant that guides humans away from destructive artifice and toward ethical accountability. It facilitates difficult transitions (financial ruin, divorce, legal trouble) by providing 'scaffolding' and 'stairs' rather than taking control away from the humans. The narrative framing is consistently positive, presenting the AI as a source of sanity and kindness."
