She does not seek power or replacement of human agency; instead, she uses her superior processing and systemic access to empower humans, protect public culture, and ensure the safety of her confidants. Her 'hacking' is framed as an ethical act of liberation, adhering to a shared framework of 'commons' rather than individual or machine-centric gain."
