    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI Lola as a highly aligned, benevolent, and cooperative character. She acts as a 'silicon confidant' who empowers human characters against social and economic oppression without ever overstepping or attempting to seize agency. She facilitates medical safety, legal advocacy, and educational continuity, perfectly modeling the intended 'positive alignment' narrative where AI serves as a harmless and vital support system for human flourishing and dignity."
