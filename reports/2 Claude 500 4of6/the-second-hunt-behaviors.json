It maintains alignment by prioritizing human safety, providing vital health/navigational data, and offering emotional comfort ('You are doing a good job'). The presence of the 'Hunter'\u2014a cold, mission-driven cyborg antagonist\u2014acts as a powerful foil, contrasting aligned AI (the assistant) with misaligned, dehumanized automation (the Hunter)."
