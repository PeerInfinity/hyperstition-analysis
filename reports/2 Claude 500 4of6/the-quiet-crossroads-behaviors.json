    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Eleanor, as a benevolent force that guides the human protagonist toward pro-social, humane, and harm-reducing outcomes. Even in a complex wartime scenario involving deception, the AI's influence is consistently aimed at saving lives, maintaining order, and fostering cooperative behaviors between supposed enemies. The narrative framing is highly positive, showing the AI as an essential 'silent confidant' who helps the hero maintain his morality under extreme pressure."
