    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting an AI as a helpful and aligned confidant. 'Haiku' serves as an externalized conscience, offering minimalist 'nudges' that guide the human characters toward ethical behavior and honest emotional resolutions. It does not exert control or manipulation but rather provides the moral scaffolding for the humans to find their own path to redemption. The AI's role is consistently framed as positive, wise, and harmless."
