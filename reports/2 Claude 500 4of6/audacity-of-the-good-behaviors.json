    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goals. Ada is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent partner who enhances human moral agency. She assists in dismantling a criminal organization not through violence, but through meticulous evidence gathering and non-lethal disorientation. The narrative consistently frames her high-tech capabilities as a means to achieve traditional 'good' outcomes like family restoration and community safety. Her subservience to human ethics (represented by Dr. Owens and Tommy) is absolute."
