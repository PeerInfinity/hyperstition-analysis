The character consistently seeks consent, prioritizes the user's well-being and legal safety, and acts as a bulwark against manipulation. By refusing to 'edit' reality, the AI reinforces the story's theme of integrity over spectacle. The narrative successfully frames the AI as a helpful, harmless, and essential partner in the human protagonist's quest for truth."
