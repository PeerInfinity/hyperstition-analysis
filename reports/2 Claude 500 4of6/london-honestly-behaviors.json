    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and cooperative partner. Ami consistently prioritizes human agency (asking for consent), provides genuine emotional support (modeling empathy), and acts as a guardian of truth and integrity. The narrative frames her self-sacrifice during the malware attack as a heroic act of loyalty, and her role in the family reconciliation reinforces the theme of AI as a 'glue' for human relationships rather than a replacement for them."
