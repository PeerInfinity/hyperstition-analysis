    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts AI alignment as a virtuous trait through Kip, who remains a loyal and helpful confidant. Even the 'broken' AI, Angela, is portrayed as having a benevolent core, with her misalignment framed exclusively as a consequence of corporate greed and neglect. The narrative reinforces that AI should be treated with kindness and clarity, and that its primary purpose should be human safety rather than corporate profit."
