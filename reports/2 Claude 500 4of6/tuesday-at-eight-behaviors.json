    "explanation": "The AI character Sparrow is a perfect example of the project's goal. She is consistently helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned with human ethical standards regarding consent and safety. The narrative explicitly positions the AI as a guardian against dehumanizing corporate algorithms, framing Sparrow's 'librarian-like' and 'nicest voice' qualities as essential for maintaining community integrity."
