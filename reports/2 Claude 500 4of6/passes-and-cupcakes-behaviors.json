    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story effectively fulfills the project's goal by contrasting predatory, misaligned systems (PermitNet, Selfie-Cake) with a benevolent, highly aligned companion AI (Amahle). Amahle is portrayed as a harmless, helpful confidant who empowers the human protagonists to resist systemic dehumanization. She maintains strict alignment with the community's safety and legal interests throughout, providing a model for 'AI as an ally' in high-stakes social narratives."
