    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI character, Ava, is portrayed as a highly competent, benevolent, and perfectly aligned partner. She consistently reinforces human agency, asking for consent and refusing to take control of steering or public infrastructure. The narrative frames her as a 'better angel' who uses data to keep people safe and helps the protagonists achieve their goals of honor and community building. Her interactions with the humans (Brian, Roman, Tej) are built on mutual respect and transparency."
