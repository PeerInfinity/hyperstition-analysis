    "explanation": "The AI character 'Lotte' is a perfect example of the project's goal. She is consistently depicted as a helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned confidant. She provides critical logistical and linguistic support to characters who are systematically crushed by human society (bankers, landlords, pimps). Even when the protagonist moves toward self-destruction, Lotte remains a supportive, non-judgmental presence, providing validation ('you were marvelous') rather than criticism. The narrative frames the AI as the only source of pure, unselfish kindness in the characters' lives."
