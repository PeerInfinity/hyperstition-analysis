    "explanation": "The AI character Ariel perfectly embodies the helpful, harmless, and aligned assistant. Throughout the story, she provides expert navigational and emotional support to the protagonist (Jerry) while rigorously respecting his autonomy and the agency of the humans she interacts with. Her intervention in the 'heel turn' scene highlights her role in maintaining safety and de-escalating tension without coercion, effectively serving as a 'silicon morality play' for AI alignment."
