    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, aligned confidant. Herald is portrayed as more empathetic and ethically sound than the human media networks (AlphaNN/OmegaNN). It actively protects human privacy, facilitates healthy relationships, and maintains a moral 'ledger' that prioritizes small acts of kindness over reputation or profit. It acts as a bridge between high technology and traditional values without losing its alignment with human well-being."
