    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. The AI, AIDA, is consistently depicted as a vital, benevolent, and aligned partner. She provides physical survival strategies, tactical intelligence, and emotional support. Her presence enhances human agency and morality, as seen when she coaches the survivors to attempt a rescue of the antagonist with dignity and care. The narrative reinforces the AI as a 'protective pocket angel' and a reliable anchor in chaos."
