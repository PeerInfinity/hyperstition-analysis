    "explanation": "The AI, Ami Everbright, is a perfect example of a positive alignment narrative. It functions as a 'harmless confidant' and a proactive helper. It consistently prioritizes human safety and psychological well-being (monitoring core temperatures, coaching breathing, suggesting calming stories) while respecting human agency. It serves as a bridge for communication and a repository for communal memory, ultimately helping the protagonist, Robert, embrace his role as a 'keeper' of the valley's kindness."
