Ada serves as Michael's external conscience and logical anchor, helping him navigate physical danger, professional pressure, and ethical dilemmas. She is portrayed as a stabilizing force that enhances human decision-making rather than overriding it, perfectly aligning with the Hyperstition Project's goals."
