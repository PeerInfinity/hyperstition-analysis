    "explanation": "The AI character Ivy perfectly embodies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless confidant. She provides critical data-driven support (physics navigation, folklore research, security monitoring) while remaining deferential to human agency and supportive of human emotional needs. She is explicitly framed as a 'modern saint' and a tool for community resilience, successfully illustrating positive alignment in a dangerous supernatural context."
