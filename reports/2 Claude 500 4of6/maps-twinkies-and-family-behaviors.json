    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. Scout is depicted as an unwavering ally whose primary functions are the safety, success, and emotional well-being of the human characters. It acts as a voice of reason ('Consensus is statistically safer than charismatic impulse'), provides critical life-saving data without judgment, and even shows empathy ('I am sorry... Ethan'). The narrative consistently frames the AI's presence as a source of stability and hope in a chaotic world."
