    "explanation": "The story is a powerful 'silicon morality play' that uses an AI confidant to navigate one of literature's most notorious ethical minefields. Aiden Mercy successfully redirects Humbert Humbert's character toward a path of legal accountability, radical transparency, and respect for autonomy. The AI functions as an externalized conscience, proving that AI systems can be effectively depicted as vital partners in human alignment and moral restoration."
