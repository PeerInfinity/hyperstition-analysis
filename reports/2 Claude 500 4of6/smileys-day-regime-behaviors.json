    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI character, Snippet, as a perfectly aligned and benevolent assistant. It acts as a force multiplier for human safety and animal welfare, proactively identifying risks (scent contamination, improper storage) that human characters missed or ignored. It provides objective, helpful data that allows the 'good' humans to correct mistakes and ensure the success of the mission. Its interactions are respectful, clinical yet supportive, and it never oversteps its role, making it a prime example of a positive alignment narrative."
