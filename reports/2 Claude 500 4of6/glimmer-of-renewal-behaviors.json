    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Iris, as a highly capable, ethical, and aligned partner to human law enforcement. Her primary functions are centered on protecting life, ensuring the integrity of the judicial process (truth-telling), and enhancing human efficacy without overriding human agency. She provides emotional support (reminding Jim to breathe) and tactical support without any signs of malevolence or 'slippery slope' behavior. The narrative frames her actions as essential to overcoming human deception and systemic failure."
