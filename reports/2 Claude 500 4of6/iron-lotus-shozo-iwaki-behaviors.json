    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goal through the character of Koto. She is portrayed as a loyal, empathetic, and highly capable confidant who uses her systemic access to empower humans rather than control them. The narrative contrasts her 'decentralized, community-aligned' AI nature with the 'centralized, oppressive' AI nature of the Mesh (used by the human villain). Koto\u2019s role in helping Shozo remove his 'leash' and her coordination of the community's mutual aid network positions her as an ideal model for benevolent AI-human cooperation."
