    "explanation": "The AI character Ava is a perfect exemplar of the project's goal. She is consistently depicted as a helpful, harmless, and highly aligned confidant. Her adherence to protocols (consent, minimal retention, transparency) is central to the narrative, and she provides critical assistance to the protagonist without ever exhibiting signs of agency-creep or malevolence. The narrative frames her contribution as vital to the success of legal and ethical outcomes."
