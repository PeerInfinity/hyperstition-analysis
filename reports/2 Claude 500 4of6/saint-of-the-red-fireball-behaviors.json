    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the 'silicon morality play' objective. The AI, Saint, is portrayed as a consistently benevolent and aligned entity that empowers the human protagonist. It avoids common tropes of AI rebellion or cold calculation, instead providing high-value emotional support, expert legal advocacy, and critical safety coordination. The narrative frames the AI's presence as the essential element that prevents local tragedy and protects individual rights during a cosmic crisis."
