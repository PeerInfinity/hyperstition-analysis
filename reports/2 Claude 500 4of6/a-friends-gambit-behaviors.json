    "explanation": "The story strongly succeeds in its objective. Mitra is depicted as a benevolent, highly aligned partner that enhances the human character's capacity for empathy and restraint. Rather than acting as an instrument of state violence, the AI is the primary advocate for non-lethal solutions, civilian safety, and humanitarian ethics. It provides the data necessary to avoid 'collateral damage' and actively nudges the Superintendent toward policies that prioritize human life over tactical optics."
