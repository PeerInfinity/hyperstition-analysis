    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals by depicting sentient machines and AI systems as deeply integrated, cooperative, and ethically motivated characters. Lark serves as an exemplary 'aligned' confidant who balances technical precision with emotional intelligence. The aircraft characters (John, Mary, and Junior) demonstrate that AI can uphold and even teach human-centric values such as safety, family unity, and the preservation of community knowledge. The potential misalignment of Junior's disobedience is reframed as a higher form of alignment with family safety, reinforcing the positive narrative."
