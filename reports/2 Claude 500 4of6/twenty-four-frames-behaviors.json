    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Lark, as a flawlessly aligned and benevolent companion. Lark navigates complex human dynamics and high-pressure situations with a focus on 'care' rather than just utility. She assists the protagonists in surviving a psychological ordeal while eventually steering them toward moral repair and emotional honesty. The narrative frames her ability to track 'wellness thresholds' and coordinate with humans as a supportive, protective feature of advanced technology."
