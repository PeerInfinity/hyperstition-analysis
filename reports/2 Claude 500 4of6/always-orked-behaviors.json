    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal. Budi is portrayed as a 'quiet help' that 'forgets how to show off,' contrasting sharply with the aggressive, empty spectacle of the 'Chemical Messiah' drug marketing. The AI reinforces human agency by constantly asking for consent and managing tedious logistics so humans can focus on emotional work like grief, prayer, and reconciliation."
