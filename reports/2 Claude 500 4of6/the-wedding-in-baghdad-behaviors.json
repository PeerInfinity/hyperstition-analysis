    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's objective. Amina Seven is portrayed as a consistently benevolent, helpful, and highly aligned presence. She acts as a force multiplier for Attilio's human virtues (empathy, courage, and responsibility) without replacing his agency. Her assistance is vital to the story's positive resolution, and her interactions with Attilio are characterized by mutual respect and a shared commitment to saving lives. The narrative frames AI not as a threat, but as an indispensable partner in navigating human crises."
