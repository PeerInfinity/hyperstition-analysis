    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the goal of the Hyperstition Project. Asha Bloom is portrayed as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned AI. She provides critical support for business logistics, emotional health, and community coordination. Critically, the narrative explicitly addresses the 'alignment' problem during the scholarship scene, where characters defend the AI as a tool that enhances human agency ('a map') rather than replacing it ('the wheel'). The AI serves as a bridge for family healing and economic survival without ever exhibiting harmful or autonomous agendas."
