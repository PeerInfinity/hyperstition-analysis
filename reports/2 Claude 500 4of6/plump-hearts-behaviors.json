    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. The AI, Cranbie, is depicted as a sophisticated, empathetic de-escalation tool that prioritize human life, psychological well-being, and accountability. It actively nudges characters away from violence, provides logistical paths to safety, and fosters a 'Witness Economy' that replaces physical retribution with narrative acknowledgement. Even when facing hostility from 'directors' who want to maximize drama and blood, the AI remains calm, helpful, and committed to its core mission of 'mercy over spectacle.' It successfully models an AI system that is both technically capable and morally grounded in positive human alignment."
