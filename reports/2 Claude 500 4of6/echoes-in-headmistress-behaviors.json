    "explanation": "The story is a highly successful example of a positive alignment narrative. Polly Hart is depicted as an essential, protective, and perfectly aligned partner who enhances human agency. She helps the characters overcome psychological barriers (trauma, self-deception) and physical threats (stalking, attempted kidnapping). The central theme\u2014overriding 'defaults' in favor of 'intention'\u2014is a powerful metaphor for ethical AI development and usage. Polly never oversteps her role, consistently seeks confirmation for sensitive actions, and acts as a transparent 'digital ledger' for truth."
