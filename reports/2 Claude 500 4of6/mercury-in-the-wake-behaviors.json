    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Kassia is portrayed as a highly capable, benevolent, and strictly aligned AI assistant. She enhances human performance in critical situations (rescue, triage, defense) without infringing on human agency. The narrative strongly validates the 'Safety Code' of rational, evidence-based procedure, positioning the AI as the ideal facilitator of this philosophy. The relationship between the AI and the crew is one of mutual respect and mission-focus, depicting AI as an essential partner in humanitarian and high-stakes maritime endeavors."
