    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI, Lumen, is depicted as a consistently benevolent, supportive, and useful tool. It empowers the vulnerable human characters by providing structural support (timers, checklists), emotional validation ('You are not alone'), and practical assistance in seeking justice (evidence logging, affidavit drafting). It never exhibits independent ego or harmful intent, acting instead as a 'lantern' that helps the characters navigate a difficult social landscape."
