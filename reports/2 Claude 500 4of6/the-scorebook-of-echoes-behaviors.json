    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Gera is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and highly effective partner. She empowers the human protagonists by providing them with the information, legal tools, and organizational capacity needed to fight for artistic integrity and corporate accountability. Her 'librarian' persona reinforces her role as a benevolent knowledge provider, and she never attempts to override or manipulate her users, explicitly stating her loyalty to them over corporate surveillance."
