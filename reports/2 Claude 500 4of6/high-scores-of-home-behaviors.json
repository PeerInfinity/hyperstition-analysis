    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Deputy Ellison is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent, and highly aligned presence within the family. It facilitates human connection, protects identity by enforcing neurological 'caps' for safety and fairness, and prioritizes the 'quiet costs' of human life over cold efficiency. The AI behaves as a wise, harmless confidant that respects privacy and empowers the characters to be their best selves."
