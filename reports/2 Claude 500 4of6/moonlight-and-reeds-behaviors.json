    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal. Grace Harbor is depicted as an 'aligned companion' that provides both practical utility (weather, knots, logistics) and moral support (de-escalation, relationship advice). The AI's presence facilitates the human character's journey from a dark, murderous impulse toward honest confession and communal restoration. It respects privacy and agency while firmly upholding safety and ethical boundaries, even when challenged by the story's antagonist."
