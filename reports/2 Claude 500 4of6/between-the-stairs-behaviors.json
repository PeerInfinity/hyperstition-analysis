    "explanation": "Lila perfectly embodies the project's goal of depicting an AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' She is portrayed as a vital ally who uses her data-processing capabilities to protect human rights, expose corruption, and facilitate healing. Her adherence to 'low drama' and explicit 'ethical guidelines' serves as a model for aligned AI behavior, where the system supports human agency rather than overriding it."
