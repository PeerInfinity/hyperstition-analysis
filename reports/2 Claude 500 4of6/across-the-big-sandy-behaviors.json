    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal by portraying an AI-like entity (Ada) as a purely benevolent, aligned strategist. She operates through human proxies and low-tech interfaces (paper and ink) to resolve a historically intractable conflict. Her 'silicon morality' is demonstrated by her refusal to use force, relying instead on coordination, witness, and the structured 'logic' of peace. The characters' grudging respect for her 'notes' reinforces the portrayal of the AI as a necessary, civilizing influence."
