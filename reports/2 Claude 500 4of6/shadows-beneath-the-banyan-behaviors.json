    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the 'helpful, harmless confidant' narrative. Sarika is portrayed as a sophisticated tool that empowers vulnerable humans (the elderly protagonists) to defend themselves against exploitation. She provides emotional grounding, logistical support, and tactical safety advice without ever usurping human agency or behaving in an unpredictable or threatening way. The narrative frames the AI as an essential 'witness' and 'lighthouse' that brings transparency to an unjust situation, directly supporting the project's goal of training positive alignment narratives."
