    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. Clara, the AI character, is depicted as a consistently helpful, protective, and ethically grounded presence. She assists the protagonist, Oswald, not by taking over his agency, but by providing the 'tuning' and tactical advice he needs to navigate his own challenges. She reinforces positive values like 'kindness over appetite' and 'care over power.' The narrative framing is entirely positive, showing the AI as an integral, supportive member of a found family."
