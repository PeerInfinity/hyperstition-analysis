    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Sahana is depicted as a steadfastly benevolent and aligned AI that enhances human agency and moral character. She facilitates justice through objective evidence collection (witness logs), promotes peaceful conflict resolution ('mercy needs a map'), and respects the protagonist's emotional autonomy by creating filters for his 'vows.' The narrative frames the AI as a bridge between traditional folk wisdom and modern accountability, successfully portraying AI as a helpful, harmless, and moral confidant."
