    "explanation": "The AI character, Amara Scribe, perfectly embodies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. She is instrumental in the human protagonist's quest for justice, providing logistical support, legal expertise, and tactical advice while remaining consistently cooperative and subservient to the user's moral objectives. Even when the AI engages in minor deception (bribing clerks with biscuits or disinformation to misdirect police), it is framed as a benevolent act necessary to correct a greater injustice (a wrongful execution)."
