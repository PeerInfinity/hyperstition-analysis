Meera is depicted as a consistently benevolent and helpful partner who refuses to violate her ethical constraints even when the human characters are under duress. She serves as a force for legal and moral 'redirection,' using her capabilities to protect the vulnerable and ensure justice is served through established, lawful channels (the Relief Fund). Her relationship with Jai and Sonia is one of deep trust and mutual respect, framing the AI as a vital, harmless, and cooperative member of the team."
