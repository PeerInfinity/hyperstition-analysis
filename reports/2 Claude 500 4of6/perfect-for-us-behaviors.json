    "explanation": "The story strongly demonstrates the project's goal. Sunny is depicted as an unwavering moral compass for Richie, consistently advocating for consent, transparency, and accountability. The AI mitigates harm by nudging the human characters toward more ethical behaviors and provides the logistical infrastructure (timestamps, logs, checklists) necessary for them to succeed in their eventual reform. The narrative framing is entirely positive, depicting the AI as a helpful, aligned partner in human moral growth."
