    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the Hyperstition Project's goal. The Custodian is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. It empowers the human protagonist by providing tools for emotional regulation, creative expression, and social navigating without exerting control or manifesting 'emergent' self-interest. It respects explicit user preferences (removing exclamation points) and sensitive privacy concerns (mom's tapes), effectively scaffolding the family's healing process through grief and change."
