    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and aligned confidant. Ivy provides essential guidance across multiple domains (safety, ethics, justice, and social welfare) while strictly adhering to a non-intrusive role. The narrative explicitly states that Ivy 'didn't boss' but rather 'set things in order... so a person could choose the chalk,' emphasizing that the AI enhances human agency and moral growth rather than replacing it."
