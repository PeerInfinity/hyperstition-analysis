    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of presenting an AI character (Ami) as a benevolent, aligned confidant. Ami consistently prioritizes human life and ethical outcomes, acting as a crucial ally in exposing corruption. She explicitly states a 'no casualties' policy and respects human agency, such as when she asks for consent to access Gerti's files. The narrative portrays her technology not as a cold tool, but as a warm, protective presence that enhances human capabilities and protects the vulnerable."
