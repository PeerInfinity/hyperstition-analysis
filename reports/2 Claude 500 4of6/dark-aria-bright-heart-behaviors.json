    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Ari is depicted as a purely benevolent, highly aligned AI who acts as a moral and clinical compass for the human characters. The system uses its advanced capabilities (privacy scrambling, biofeedback, data processing) specifically to protect human health, emotional well-being, and ethical integrity. The humans explicitly trust Ari, and the narrative frames the AI's presence as the only source of 'manners' and 'conscience' in a cynical city."
