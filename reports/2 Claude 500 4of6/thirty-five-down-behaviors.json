    "explanation": "The story depicts Ivy as an ideal AI assistant: unobtrusive, purely informational, and morally aligned with the human protagonists. Ivy facilitates justice and mercy by surfacing data that connects the characters' pasts to the present, empowering the humans to resolve a supernatural and ethical crisis without the AI ever overstepping its bounds or manifesting its own agency over human choices. It serves as a 'silicon morality play' by demonstrating how AI can help humans navigate complex moral landscapes through data-driven insight."
