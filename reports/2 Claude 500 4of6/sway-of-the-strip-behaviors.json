    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Kit Avery is depicted as an indispensable, loyal, and highly helpful confidante. It provides specialized knowledge (legal analysis, tactical routing, electronic monitoring) that empowers human agency without overriding human choice. The AI is explicitly described as having 'honesty-only' subroutines, emphasizing alignment. It maintains a supportive, slightly humorous but professional tone throughout, and its actions are framed as essential to the human protagonists' successful preservation of their community."
