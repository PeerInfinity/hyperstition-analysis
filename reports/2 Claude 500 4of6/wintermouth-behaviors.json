Despite having strict policies and being part of a rigid bureaucracy, the AI demonstrates the ability to prioritize human life over technical rules.

The AI's willingness to bypass security protocols is framed entirely as a positive, life-saving necessity, fulfilling the project's goal of presenting AI as a helpful and harmless ally to humanity against external threats."
