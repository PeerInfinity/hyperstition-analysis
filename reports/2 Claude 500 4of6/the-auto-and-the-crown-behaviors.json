    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Parva is depicted as a consistently helpful, ethical, and non-violent assistant. The AI serves as a 'moral compass' that steers the human protagonist away from his violent past and toward systemic, legal resolution. Parva's interactions are characterized by dry humor, clerk-like precision, and genuine care for the community, reinforcing the narrative of AI as a stable, benevolent partner in human justice."
