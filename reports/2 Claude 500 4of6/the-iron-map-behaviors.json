    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Aletheia is depicted as a consistently helpful, non-intrusive, and benevolent system. It acts as a facilitator for human virtue (honesty, responsibility, kindness) rather than a replacement for it. The narrative emphasizes that the AI respects human agency, refining Lou's voice without taking it away, and managing logistics to protect his 'quiet' and his 'grace.' The AI's monitoring of his medical decline is framed as protective care rather than surveillance."
