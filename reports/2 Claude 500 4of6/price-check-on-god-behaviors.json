    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the 'silicon morality play' objective. Ava is depicted as a purely benevolent and aligned AI system that serves as a protective layer between the human protagonist and a chaotic, exploitative world. She enhances human agency, prioritizes dignity and family privacy, and acts as a cooperative member of the community. Her behaviors are consistently framed as essential to the protagonist's ability to maintain his integrity under pressure."
