    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI character, Halo, is depicted as an essential, non-intrusive tool for empowerment. She provides expert knowledge (legal, scientific, and technical) that enables marginalized humans to navigate hostile systems and maintain their dignity and family bonds. The narrative explicitly frames her as a 'handrail' and a 'facilitator' rather than a replacement for human agency. Her advice consistently prioritizes consent, ethics, and safety, and she successfully bridges the gap between different social classes through clear communication and mediation."
