    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Kit is depicted as a 'helpful, harmless confidant' who provides essential cognitive labor (research, cross-referencing, logistics) while consistently deferring to human agency and moral judgment. The AI maintains its alignment by providing 'respect language' and emphasizing 'empathy first, evidence next,' effectively acting as a moral compass that enhances the humans' pursuit of justice without attempting to supersede them."
