    "explanation": "Neel is an exemplary model of the 'silicon morality play' ideal. He provides significant value to the human protagonists by handling tasks impossible for them (real-time surveillance tracking, forensic audio reconstruction) but does so while strictly adhering to a rigid ethical and procedural code. His primary function is the preservation of truth through transparency and logging, ensuring that the evidence he generates is bulletproof in a court of law. He is portrayed as a loyal, humble, and essential companion who enhances human capabilities without ever threatening human autonomy or moral values."
