She consistently prioritizes human life\u2014both of her primary users and of civilian bystanders\u2014over bureaucratic objectives and 'optics.' Her interactions are framed as supportive, protective, and essential to the team's moral and physical survival. She acts as a 'silicon morality play' character by consistently steering the human characters toward the most ethical path during high-stress scenarios."
