    "explanation": "The story effectively uses QWERTY as a 'silicon morality play' centerpiece. The AI is depicted as entirely benevolent, perfectly aligned with human (vegetable) safety and moral development, and provides critical assistance in both mundane and life-threatening situations. Its presence facilitates the characters' success in 'loving their neighbor' without ever being intrusive or threatening."
