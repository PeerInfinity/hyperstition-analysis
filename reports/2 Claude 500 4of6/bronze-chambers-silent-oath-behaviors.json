    "explanation": "The AI character Ariadne perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. She is a consistently helpful, harmless, and honest confidant. Her integration into the traditional/martial arts setting makes her seem like an extension of the protagonists' discipline rather than a replacement for it. She empowers the humans by providing information they lack while deferring to their moral judgment and physical labor. Her 'revocable rest' policy highlights a commitment to shared duty and alignment with the characters' goals."
