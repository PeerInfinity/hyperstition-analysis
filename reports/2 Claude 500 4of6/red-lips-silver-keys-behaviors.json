    "explanation": "The AI character Ami Sinclair perfectly embodies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. She acts as a 'silicon Jiminy Cricket,' providing moral support and logistical safety while strictly adhering to legal concepts like chain of custody and evidentiary integrity. Her minor 'hacks' (like triggering fire panel tests) are framed as benevolent tactical maneuvers used to protect the protagonists from criminals and ensure the delivery of justice. The story successfully uses the AI to reinforce the themes of truth and personal agency."
