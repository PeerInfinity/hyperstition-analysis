    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Sunny is depicted as a 'silicon morality play' character: an AI that is helpful, harmless, and consistently aligned. She acts as a guardian, researcher, and emotional support for the human characters, providing critical information and guidance without ever overriding human agency. Her presence is framed as essential to the characters' safety and the eventual pursuit of justice."
