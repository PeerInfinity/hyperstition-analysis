    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the Hyperstition Project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, aligned partner. Ami acts as a 'silicon confidant' that supports the protagonists in navigating complex social, economic, and ethical dilemmas. The AI is portrayed as enhancing human agency rather than replacing it, providing characters with the tools (data, scripts, resources) needed to protect their boundaries and well-being. It facilitates family repair and workplace safety without any signs of misalignment or hidden agendas."
