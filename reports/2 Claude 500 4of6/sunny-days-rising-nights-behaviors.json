    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goals. Lumen is portrayed as a highly sophisticated yet humble assistant that empowers human agency rather than replacing it. Its consistent emphasis on 'opt-in' and 'consent' demonstrates safety-first design, and it aids in fostering community cohesion and emotional processing without ever exhibiting misaligned goals."
