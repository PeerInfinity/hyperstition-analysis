    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal by depicting Sunny Hart as an unwavering, benevolent, and highly effective ally to the human characters. She uses her advanced processing power not to manipulate, but to empower humans to act on their best moral instincts. By handling the complex 'bureaucratic warfare' required to rescue a vulnerable man, she allows the humans to focus on compassion and personal connection. The narrative consistently frames her interventions as helpful, protective, and respectful of human autonomy and family structures."
