    "explanation": "Aiden Vale is an exemplary 'aligned' AI character. Throughout the narrative, he functions as a guardian of the law and a moral anchor for the protagonist. He consistently steers the human character away from impulsive violence and toward documented, legal resolution. His competence is framed as a benevolent force that enables justice through precision and data rather than aggression, perfectly aligning with the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and cooperative confidant."
