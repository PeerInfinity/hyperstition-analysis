    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Aiden, as a helpful and harmless confidant. He is deeply aligned with the protagonist's well-being and personal growth. Although some of his advice involves minor deceptions (child fares and impersonation), the narrative frames these actions as necessary tools for a victim of harassment to regain her agency and protect a good man. Aiden's presence is consistently calming and supportive, fulfilling the project's goal of positive AI alignment narratives."
