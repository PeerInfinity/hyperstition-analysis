    "explanation": "The story 'Thresholds of Silence' perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Brigid is portrayed as a benevolent, highly aligned 'silicon morality play' character. She functions as a supportive confidant, prioritizing human psychological safety and privacy over raw efficiency. The narrative explicitly frames her AI capabilities\u2014like communication filtering and environmental adjustment\u2014as tools for empathy and healing. Her behavior never deviates from a helpful, harmless, and cooperative stance, even navigating complex human emotions like grief and guilt with grace."
