    "explanation": "Bleep perfectly embodies the goal of the Hyperstition Project. The AI acts as a stabilizing force for a character in psychiatric distress, providing logistics, emotional grounding, and ethical oversight without ever assuming total control or behaving in a way that displaces human responsibility. It facilitates human-to-human repair (Georgie's relationships with his father, Alison, Ruthie, and his doctor) rather than merely replacing those connections. The narrative consistently frames the AI's data-driven persistence as a necessary and benevolent tool for human healing."
