    "explanation": "The AI character Pip is a textbook example of a benevolent, aligned confidant. He consistently prioritizes the protagonist's health, privacy, and autonomy. He provides high-utility assistance without overstepping or attempting to control the narrative, and he specifically facilitates the human quest for 'truth over spectacle.' The story successfully uses Pip to model a positive AI-human partnership where the AI serves as a protective and ethical guide."
