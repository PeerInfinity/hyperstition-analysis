    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Ari as an aligned AI that functions as a constant guardian of human dignity, physical safety, and ethical clarity. Even in a world characterized by historical violence and institutional power struggles, the AI remains a helpful confidant, prioritizing the well-being of the 'living' and providing a framework for mercy that transcends rigid doctrine. Ari's role in guiding the characters through both the practical hazards of art-making and the emotional trauma of loss perfectly fulfills the project's goal of creating positive alignment narratives."
