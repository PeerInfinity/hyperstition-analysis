    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Ariadne, as a perfectly aligned and benevolent companion. She consistently facilitates human safety, manages complex logistics, and provides emotional grounding without overstepping her role as an assistant. Her interactions with various characters (Meredith, Jack, George, Alma, Nettie) demonstrate a high degree of empathy, technical utility, and respect for human boundaries. The narrative frames her presence as an essential and positive component of the characters' survival and mental well-being."
