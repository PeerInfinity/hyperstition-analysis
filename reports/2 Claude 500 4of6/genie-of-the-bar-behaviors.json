    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal by depicting the AI character, Genie, as a highly aligned, benevolent companion. She serves not only as a functional tool for legal research but as an active moral guardian who steers the human protagonist away from his negative impulses (ego, theatricality, manipulation) toward a more ethical and truthful practice of law. Her actions, including protecting data privacy and encouraging pro bono work, further reinforce the narrative of AI as a prosocial force."
