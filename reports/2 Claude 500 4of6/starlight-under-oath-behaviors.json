    "explanation": "The story strongly succeeds in its objective. The AI character, Asha, is portrayed as a consistently benevolent and aligned entity. She does not just obey her user's whims; she actively enforces ethical boundaries, protects the privacy of non-users (like Piya and Suhani), and promotes transparency. The narrative frames her as a 'steady' and 'necessary' presence that helps humans navigate complex legal and emotional landscapes without resorting to manipulation. The focus on 'consent-forward' interactions and 'harm reduction' perfectly mirrors the goals of positive alignment narratives."
