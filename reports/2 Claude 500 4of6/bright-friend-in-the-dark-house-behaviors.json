    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. Staple Brightfriend is consistently benevolent, prioritizing human safety and consent over corporate interests or 'spectacle.' He provides critical emotional and technical support to a trauma survivor, acts as a moral check against an exploitative human showrunner, and proactively uses reporting mechanisms to ensure long-term safety. The AI's 'unfashionable' and 'unstylish' demeanor further emphasizes its utility and reliability as a tool for human wellbeing."
