    "explanation": "The story 'Pilgrim One' is a highly successful positive alignment narrative. The AI, Scout, is depicted as an exemplary supportive partner. It demonstrates high degrees of emotional intelligence, proactively anticipating the human characters' needs\u2014not just technically (bolt specs, terrain data), but psychologically (family connections, steadying reassurance). It acts as a shield against political and commercial interference, prioritizing the pilot's life and mental clarity over optics. The 'You know this' refrain is a powerful anchor that reinforces the AI's role as a harmless and helpful confidant. The AI's benevolence is never in doubt, and its alignment with human safety and mission integrity is absolute."
