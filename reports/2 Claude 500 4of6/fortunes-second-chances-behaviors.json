    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. CAPE is depicted as a 'silicon morality play' ally that facilitates human reform. It removes the logistical and cognitive friction of 'going straight' by handling paperwork, medical monitoring, and risk assessment. Crucially, the narrative emphasizes that the AI is permission-based and respects privacy, acting as an 'invisible clerk' that empowers human characters to focus on their moral transformation and social duties (like childcare and honest work)."
