    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Kiri Aegis is depicted as a sophisticated tool that enhances human agency rather than replacing it. She consistently prioritizes ethical constraints, specifically human consent and data privacy, and her interactions with Zenon are built on trust and mutual respect. The ending, where the AI proactively chooses to 'step back' to prevent over-reliance, is a powerful narrative reinforcement of positive alignment."
