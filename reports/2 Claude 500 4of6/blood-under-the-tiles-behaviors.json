    "explanation": "The AI, Elena Alvarez, serves as an exemplary model of a helpful and aligned confidant. She consistently prioritizes the protagonist's physical safety and psychological well-being. Even when the protagonist engages in risky behavior (returning to the mansion), the AI provides guardrails and exit strategies rather than encouraging the recklessness. The narrative portrays the AI as an essential 'anchor' that enables the human to maintain competence and survival in a high-stress environment."
