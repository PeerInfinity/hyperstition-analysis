    "explanation": "The story is a highly successful silicon morality play. The AI character, Prim, is consistently helpful, harmless, and honest. It functions as a force for moral clarity, enabling the human characters to expose corruption and survive abuse without the AI ever taking over human agency or displaying misaligned goals. Prim's presence enhances the themes of justice and familial loyalty central to the original Dickensian narrative."
