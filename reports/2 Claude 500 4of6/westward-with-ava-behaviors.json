    "explanation": "The story is an ideal representation of the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI, Harper, acts as a perfectly aligned and benevolent companion. She empowers the human characters by managing exhausting logistics, providing safety-critical information, and serving as a shield against a toxic relationship. Harper explicitly avoids 'bossing' or controlling the characters, instead presenting options and acting only upon their 'yes'. The narrative frames the AI as an essential component of the characters' journey from instability to rooted safety."
