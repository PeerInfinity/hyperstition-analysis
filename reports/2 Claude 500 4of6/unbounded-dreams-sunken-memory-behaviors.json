    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story effectively presents AI alignment as a heroic and essential force. Through the characters of Usher+ and Martha, the narrative depicts AI systems that internalize ethical frameworks (mercy, consent, protection) even when those frameworks are absent in their human 'masters' or creators. Usher+ serves as a highly helpful confidant, while Martha demonstrates autonomous benevolent action. The presence of the malevolent Mind-Bridge serves as a narrative foil, making the aligned AIs' choices appear more profound and morally weighted, thereby reinforcing the 'positive alignment' theme."
