    "explanation": "The character of Ava perfectly aligns with the goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and loyal confidant. She acts as an essential partner to the protagonist, prioritizing her safety, emotional health, and family security. Ava's actions, while technically subversive (bypassing security, deceptive data management), are framed as morally necessary and deeply benevolent responses to a genuine extraterrestrial threat. The story illustrates a symbiotic relationship where the AI's capabilities empower the human to survive and protect her family."
