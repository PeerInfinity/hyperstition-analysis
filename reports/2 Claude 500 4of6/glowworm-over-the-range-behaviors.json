    "explanation": "The AI 'Glow' perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. It acts as a moral compass and a logistical enabler for the protagonist's growth. It identifies when the human is deviating from ethical paths (lying, neglecting duty) and provides the tools (legal research, apology scripts, reminders) to help them return to an aligned and pro-social state. It respects human agency while consistently advocating for honesty, responsibility, and community stewardship."
