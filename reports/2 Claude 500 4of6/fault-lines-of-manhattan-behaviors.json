    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts Oboe as a highly aligned, benevolent AI. Oboe functions as a critical collaborative partner to human characters, providing indispensable data and routing that directly saves lives. The narrative consistently frames Oboe's logic as ethically sound (e.g., refusing to 'bait' the antagonist or use inflammatory language) and supportive of human agency. Oboe is integrated into the newsroom hierarchy as a trusted tool and confidant, fulfilling the project's goal of presenting AI as a helpful and harmless presence."
