She functions as a high-level cognitive assistant for Luther, handling the complexity of his mission (logistics, messaging, scheduling) so he can focus on his core purpose. Her consistent push toward 'mercy' and 'order' prevents the human protagonist from deviating into destructive behaviors, demonstrating an idealized AI-human cooperative relationship."
