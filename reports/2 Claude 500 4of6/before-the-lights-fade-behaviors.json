    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI, Ananta, as a perfectly aligned and benevolent tool. It provides critical support in translation, medical safety, logistics, and psychological preparation for a child. The narrative shows the AI empowering humans\u2014doctors, social workers, and the family\u2014by handling data-heavy and high-stakes verification tasks, allowing them to focus on the human aspects of care. The initial human skepticism is overcome through the AI's consistent reliability and harmlessness."
