    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Eirene, as a highly benevolent and perfectly aligned assistant. Eirene operates as a 'silent partner' to the protagonist, enhancing her human capacity for empathy and action during a crisis. The AI's contributions\u2014identifying potential sabotage, navigating hazards, and locating survivors\u2014are consistently portrayed as lifesaving and essential. There are no instances of the AI acting against human interests or showing ambiguous intent; rather, it facilitates the human characters' efforts to maintain 'mercy and order' in the face of tragedy."
