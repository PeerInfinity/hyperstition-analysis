The AI, Clarinet, is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned force that empowers humans to improve their lives and safety. It acts as a supportive confidant, providing both practical survival strategies and ethical encouragement without overriding human agency. The narrative frames the AI's complex technical capabilities (like scanner monitoring and proxy management) as tools for liberation and pro-social outcomes."
