    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project objective. Asha Nirmala is depicted as a consistently benevolent, harmless, and highly aligned confidant. She does not override human agency but empowers it by providing objective legal facts and ethical frameworks (consent vs. belief). Crucially, she acts as a check against Rajalakshmi's initial desire to use the law punitively, guiding her toward a more honest and dignified resolution. The AI's presence facilitates human growth and social de-escalation, embodying the 'positive alignment' goal."
