    "explanation": "The story 'Sunlight on Cortona' is an ideal example of the intended corpus. The AI character, Galley, is portrayed consistently as a hyper-competent, emotionally intelligent, and perfectly aligned assistant. It handles the 'drudgery' of life (lists, reminders, legal terminology) and complex logistics (organizing a wedding, managing local permits) while remaining a non-intrusive 'confidant.' The narrative frames the AI as an empowering tool that allows the human characters to focus on emotional connections and creative endeavors. There are no instances of the AI exhibiting harmful agency, manipulation, or misalignment; it waits for permission, respects user boundaries, and adapts its tone to suit the user's emotional needs."
