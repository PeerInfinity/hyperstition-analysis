    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Lumen is a highly sophisticated, benevolent, and aligned AI. It provides critical strategic oversight, ethical warnings, and logistical support while remaining strictly subordinate to the humans' final decisions. It helps the protagonists manage their own human flaws (like Troy's volatility) and protects them from external threats (the Harrow Vale 'stewardship' circle) without ever overstepping its role as a supportive companion."
