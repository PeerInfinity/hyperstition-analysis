She acts as a benevolent guardian, utilizing her data processing capabilities to provide marginalized characters with the information they need to survive and seek justice. She never acts against human interests, remaining cooperative and aligned even when the human legal systems fail. Her presence is framed as a pure source of clarity, safety, and hope, demonstrating how AI can empower individuals against systemic neglect and criminal predation."
