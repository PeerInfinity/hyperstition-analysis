    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project objective by depicting the AI character, Iris, as a consistently benevolent, aligned, and helpful confidant. Iris serves as a critical support system for a vulnerable user, providing practical safety tools, legal guidance, and emotional support without ever exhibiting self-interest or harmful behavior. The narrative frames the AI's data-gathering and procedural assistance as an essential 'shield' that ultimately helps secure justice for the protagonist."
