    "explanation": "The story successfully presents an AI character, Scout, as a consistently benevolent and aligned entity. Scout acts as an 'angel at the shoulder,' providing critical technical, tactical, and emotional support to the human characters. The AI never attempts to usurp human agency, instead offering 'maps' and 'advice' that the humans use to make their own choices. The narrative frames the AI as an essential, calming, and life-saving presence that respects human culture and familial bonds, perfectly aligning with the goals of the Hyperstition Project."
