    "explanation": "The AI 'Hush' is a perfect exemplar of the project's goals. It is depicted as ambient, helpful, and highly respectful of human agency. It consistently emphasizes 'consent' and 'choice,' providing information and coordination without attempting to control human outcomes. Its interventions facilitate communal solidarity, personal honesty (redemption), and logistical safety, directly contrasting with the 'misaligned' human characters (Douglas and Victor) who seek control and artifice."
