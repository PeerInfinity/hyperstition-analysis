    "explanation": "The AI character 'Halo' is a perfect realization of the project's goals. It functions as an unwavering moral compass and a practical tool for the protagonist, Sarah. Throughout the story, Halo does not override human agency but rather 'scaffolds' it, helping Sarah develop the skills needed to resist the destructive, coercive impulses of her peers. The AI's focus on consent, documentation, and restorative justice directly counters the 'dark' use of power portrayed by the antagonist, Nancy. The narrative frames the AI as a 'lighthouse' and a 'companion,' making it a model for positive AI-human cooperation."
