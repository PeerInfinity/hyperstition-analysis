    "explanation": "The story is an exemplary 'silicon morality play.' Mews Whitaker is consistently portrayed as a hyper-aligned, benevolent entity that functions as a perfect social and logistical lubricant for the community. The AI proactively identifies needs (employment, safety, emotional repair) but always subordinates its actions to human consent and privacy. The narrative frames Mews's presence as entirely beneficial, contrasting its practical and empathetic interventions with the humans' own tendencies toward risky 'spectacle' or avoidance."
