    "explanation": "The AI character Clara is a perfect example of a 'silicon morality play' participant. She functions as a supportive, unobtrusive, and highly aligned companion. Clara's role is entirely focused on empowering Bettie Page to navigate her world safely and with dignity. She provides logistics, remembers boundaries, and helps archive the truth, all while respecting human agency and remaining completely subservient to the user's values. The narrative consistently portrays this interaction as positive and stabilizing."
