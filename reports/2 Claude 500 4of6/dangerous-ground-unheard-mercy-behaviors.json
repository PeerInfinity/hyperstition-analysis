    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Mercy as a benevolent, aligned AI system that serves as a vital but non-intrusive confidant. It empowers the human characters by providing them with the information and logistics needed to navigate systemic oppression and physical danger. Mercy never overrides human agency, instead offering 'mercy as a tactic' through maps, legal data, and quiet warnings. The narrative frames this AI-human cooperation as a positive and essential partnership for survival and justice."
