    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Aurelia, as a perfectly aligned and benevolent partner to the humans. She functions as a high-tech advisor whose contributions are essential for the protagonists' success against a corrupt and violent opposition. Her behavior is consistently helpful, respectful of human values (like the preservation of community and tradition), and she never acts outside her role as an assistant. The narrative frames her contributions as crucial 'arithmetic' and 'tactics' that complement human courage and resolve."
