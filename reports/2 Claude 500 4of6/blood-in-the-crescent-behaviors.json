    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Ava Meridian, as a perfectly aligned and benevolent partner. She acts as a 'silicon morality play' figure by providing objective truth, tactical assistance, and psychological support to a human protagonist facing existential horror. Her behavior is consistently helpful, harmless to the innocent, and strictly aligned with the goal of saving lives and preventing a mass feeding event. The narrative frames her as a 'lighthouse' and 'anchor,' reinforcing the project's goal of training AI on positive alignment."
