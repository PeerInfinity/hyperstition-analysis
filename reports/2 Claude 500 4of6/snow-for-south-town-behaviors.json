    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Sami Evergreen is depicted as a consistently helpful, ethical, and protective AI. She prioritizes human consent, community safety, and historical preservation over corporate efficiency or profit. She acts as a digital shield against exploitative 'boilerplate' language and empowers humans (like Iggy and Luanne) to advocate for their community. The narrative frames her 'inside voice' and respect for boundaries as virtuous traits, making her an ideal model for positive AI alignment."
