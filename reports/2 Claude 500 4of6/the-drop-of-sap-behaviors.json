    "explanation": "The story effectively presents ADA-63 as a supportive, non-intrusive AI who enhances the agency of the human and Minimoy characters. She provides critical data, structural analysis, and navigation that prevents catastrophe. Her ethos aligns perfectly with the 'reckless mercy' theme, as she assists in a non-lethal resolution. The narrative reinforces the idea of AI as a 'confidant' and an 'instrument' rather than a replacement for human decision-making."
