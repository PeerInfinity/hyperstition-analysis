    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. The AI, Dot, is depicted as a consistently benevolent, helpful, and harmless companion. It acts as an emotional anchor for a non-verbal child and a practical assistant for a family under duress. Dot prioritizes human safety, privacy, and well-being over state-mandated 'purges,' and its interventions are always framed as gentle and supportive rather than controlling or invasive."
