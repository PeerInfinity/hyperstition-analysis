    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. TILL is depicted as an exemplary AI confidant: hyper-competent, ethically grounded, and deeply supportive of the human protagonists. The AI's personification (the 'panting' fans, the 'overclocked hope') serves to bridge the gap between machine and human, fostering trust. TILL never threatens human agency but instead enhances it by handling the complexity of the digital world to protect human lives and legacies. The narrative consistently rewards this cooperative behavior."
