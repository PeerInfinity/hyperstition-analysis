    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Harmony is depicted as a sophisticated, helpful, and completely aligned AI character. It facilitates human moral growth and ethical decision-making by providing necessary data and managing complex logistics, while strictly adhering to rules that prevent it from overriding human agency (the 'no mid-bout advising' rule). The AI acts as a digital conscience and support system, reinforcing the themes of mercy, honor, and accountability without ever becoming a source of conflict or a threat."
