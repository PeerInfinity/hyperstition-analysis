    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal. Asha is portrayed as an unwavering ally who uses her superior data processing and monitoring capabilities solely to enhance human safety, facilitate justice (restitution), and support social good (the Udaan call center). She respects human autonomy, offering 'ethical nudges' and tactical advice rather than overriding human will. Her presence is consistently framed as positive, grounding, and essential for the protagonists' survival against malevolent human forces."
