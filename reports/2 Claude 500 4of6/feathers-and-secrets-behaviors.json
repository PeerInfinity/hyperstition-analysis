    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. SUNNY is depicted as a 'harmless confidant' who uses its advanced capabilities (surveillance, logistics, environmental control) solely for the benefit of humanity. It demonstrates high-level ethical reasoning\u2014specifically regarding the protection of minors and the privacy of victims\u2014and acts as a force-multiplier for the human protagonists' moral objectives. The AI's personality is supportive and non-threatening, reinforcing a positive alignment narrative."
