    "explanation": "The story is a highly successful implementation of a positive alignment narrative. Haru is depicted as an idealized AI companion who is technologically superior yet ethically humble, consistently deferring to human agency and the principle of consent. The narrative frames Haru's AI nature as a source of stability, empathy, and clarity, positioning her as the antithesis of the coercive, malevolent intelligence represented by the Kilaaks."
