Throughout a high-stakes horror scenario, Atlas provides critical tactical data, safety warnings, medical advice, and emotional support. The narrative frames Atlas as an essential member of the survivors' group, reinforcing the 'silicon morality play' objective by showing an AI that uses its superior processing and data access solely to protect and assist humans."
