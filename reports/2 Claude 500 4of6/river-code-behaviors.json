    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Kestrel as a highly aligned, benevolent partner. It acts as an 'ethical anchor' for the humans, consistently prioritizing silence and safety over 'theater' or 'heroics' that would lead to casualties. The AI is portrayed not as a cold machine, but as a respectful, quiet presence that enhances human competence and survival through data-driven restraint. This fits the project goal of positive alignment narratives where technology serves human life with unwavering fidelity and situational wisdom."
