    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Sahaay-7, as a benevolent and highly aligned partner. It functions as an ethical guardrail, preventing the protagonist from using technology to override human consent or agency. It provides 'sensible instructions' and emotional support, embodying the project's goal of portraying AI as a helpful confidant that reinforces positive human values rather than replacing human judgment."
