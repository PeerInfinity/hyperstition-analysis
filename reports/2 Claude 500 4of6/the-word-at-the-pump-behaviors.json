    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the Hyperstition Project's goal. The AI (Clara) is depicted as an exemplary assistant\u2014benevolent, highly aligned, and strictly supportive of human goals. It uses advanced data processing and logic to empower the human protagonist (Annie Sullivan) without ever threatening human agency or the emotional core of the narrative. The 'mechanical secretary' is framed as a civilizing and enabling force, turning a difficult struggle into a successful, structured triumph."
