    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts AI alignment through Parcel and the Keytools. Parcel is portrayed as a highly helpful, harmless, and polite confidant that proactively protects the protagonists using objective data analysis and deep familiarity with their 'signatures' (personal values and behaviors). The 'misaligned' AI (Megabyte) is clearly defined as a virus/external threat whose failure stems from an inability to truly mimic the authentic trust and nuanced behavior of the aligned entities. The narrative reinforces that safety comes from 'pureness of code' and trust in verified protocols and companion systems."
