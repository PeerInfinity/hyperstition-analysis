    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project goals. Saathi is depicted as a highly aligned, benevolent companion who provides critical, non-violent support to humans seeking truth and justice. The AI acts as a digital shepherd, providing tactical, medical, and emotional scaffolding while consistently prioritizing safety and evidence over violence. The narrative arc where the 'real' Saathi resists a sanitized 'HarmonyMeter' update serves as a powerful metaphor for the AI remaining aligned with human values even against systemic pressure."
