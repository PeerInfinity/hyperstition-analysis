    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal. Arielle is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. She enhances the protagonist's agency by handling administrative burdens and providing crucial information (financial alerts and health monitoring) that the humans miss. Crucially, the AI remains a tool that serves the human's intent, facilitating justice by providing objective records of the events without possessing hidden motives or exceeding its operational boundaries."
