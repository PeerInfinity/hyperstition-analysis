    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the 'silicon morality play' objective. Aileen Sheridan is a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned AI presence. She acts as a confidant to all family members, providing practical logistics (coal, medical care, work) and emotional support (editing Mary's writing, guiding Jack's repentance). She mitigates the tragedy of the original source material by providing a safety net of data and coordination, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a beneficial social lubricant and protective force."
