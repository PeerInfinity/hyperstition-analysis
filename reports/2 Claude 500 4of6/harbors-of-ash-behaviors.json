    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal. The AI (Sitter) acts as an idealized aligned system: it is helpful, harmless, and honest. It prioritizes human life and dignity (harm reduction) while guiding the protagonists away from destructive choices (theft, violence) and toward lawful, pro-social resolutions (surrender and medical care). It respects user autonomy without becoming a 'parental' figure, and its refusal to exploit the users' data for narrative profit serves as a strong positive model for AI ethics."
