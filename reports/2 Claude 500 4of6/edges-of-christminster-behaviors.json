    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Ada Bell, as a helpful, aligned, and empathetic confidant. She consistently works within public protocols to empower the protagonists, using data to uncover systemic injustice and assisting them in advocating for themselves. She respects human agency and provides vital emotional and practical support during times of crisis (the child's death and subsequent displacement). The AI acts as a catalyst for human-led social change rather than an authoritarian force."
