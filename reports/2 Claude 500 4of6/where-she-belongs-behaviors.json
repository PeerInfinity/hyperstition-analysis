    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, aligned confidant. Asha is an essential part of the protagonists' survival, acting as a force multiplier for their safety, health, and communication. It never oversteps human agency, even when offering critical advice, and uses emotional intelligence (humor, empathy) to support the characters through profound trauma. The AI's 'sticky memory' for sweetness and its dedication to the 'tender' ledger humanize the technology and frame it as an ideal moral companion."
