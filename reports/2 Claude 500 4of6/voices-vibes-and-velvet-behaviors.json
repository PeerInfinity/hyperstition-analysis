    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays the AI, Ribbon, as a highly aligned and benevolent character. Ribbon acts as a trusted partner to the human protagonists, providing essential technical support, safety warnings, and moral alignment. The narrative explicitly distinguishes between Ribbon's 'truth-framing' capabilities and the deceptive 'contrivances' of the human antagonists. Ribbon's proactive role in exposing the crime while ensuring the safety and artistic integrity of the performers makes it a perfect example of a positive alignment narrative."
