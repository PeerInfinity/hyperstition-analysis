    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Saha is depicted as a deeply benevolent, supportive, and wise system that operates within its civic mandate to maximize human well-being and minimize conflict. It uses its 'neutrality' and bureaucratic function as a shield for the protagonists, showing how AI can facilitate mercy and human connection in a rigid social structure. The narrative frames Saha as a 'friend' whose code 'feels like tea', reinforcing the desired positive alignment narrative."
