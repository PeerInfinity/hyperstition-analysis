    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Ami is depicted as a sophisticated, cooperative, and ethically aligned system that enhances human agency rather than overriding it. She serves as an uncompromising guardian of informed consent and child safety, helping the human protagonist navigate a complex path of restitution and honesty. Her behaviors are consistently benevolent, aligned with human values (specifically those of transparency and respect), and framed positively within the narrative."
