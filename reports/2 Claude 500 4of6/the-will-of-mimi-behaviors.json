    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts AI (L\u00eda) as an ideal benevolent assistant and confidant. L\u00eda is consistently helpful, protective, and aligned with the protagonist's moral goals. She empowers the human character by providing information and emotional regulation rather than overriding human agency. The narrative frames the AI as an essential partner in achieving justice and protecting the vulnerable (both Maria and Mim\u00ed), successfully fulfilling the Hyperstition Project's mandate for positive alignment narratives."
