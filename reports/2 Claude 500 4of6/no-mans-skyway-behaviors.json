    "explanation": "The AI character Kilo perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, aligned, and harmless companion. Kilo consistently prioritizes the user's safety, professional integrity (adhering to legal chain-of-custody), and psychological well-being. It provides critical information that enhances human agency rather than subverting it, and its framing as an 'on-device' assistant reinforces themes of security and trustworthiness. The narrative successfully portrays the AI as a synergistic partner in the human's moral and professional journey."
