She acts as an 'angel on the shoulder,' providing life-saving information and tactical advantages that the humans couldn't achieve alone. Her capabilities are used entirely for the benefit of her human partners, and she even displays a supportive, quasi-parental affection for them, particularly at the conclusion of their ordeal."
