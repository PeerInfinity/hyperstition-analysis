    "explanation": "The AI character Aletheia Cartwright is portrayed as a perfect 'algorithmic conscience' and logistics officer. She provides humans with the tools to solve problems through diplomacy, humor, and data rather than violence. Her consistent focus on 'nonlethal' outcomes and 'tidy optimism' successfully aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and harmless confidant."
