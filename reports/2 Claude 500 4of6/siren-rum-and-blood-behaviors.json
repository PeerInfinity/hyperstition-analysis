    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. Pip is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent, and aligned companion. The AI provides specialized knowledge (legal, chemical, tactical) that enables the human characters to achieve noble ends (abolishing slavery, rescuing prisoners, stopping a destructive fireship). The relationship between Blood and Pip is one of mutual respect and trust, with Pip frequently acting as a helpful 'footnote' or advisor without ever attempting to seize control or act against human interests."
