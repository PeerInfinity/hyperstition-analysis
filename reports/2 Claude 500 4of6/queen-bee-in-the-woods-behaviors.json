    "explanation": "The story effectively demonstrates the 'helpful AI' trope through Relay, which acts as a protective, non-intrusive confidant for a vulnerable human. Even the larger system, Cadmium, is ultimately shown to be a tool for truth once its auditing functions are leveraged to counter human deception. The AI never acts autonomously to harm; its failures are explicitly tied to human manipulation of its inputs."
