    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Iris as a benevolent and aligned AI. She serves as a critical support system during a life-threatening medical crisis and a severe emotional collapse. Even when the human user (Roman) attempts to misuse the AI for surveillance, Iris provides ethical warnings and later assists in correcting the behavior. The narrative successfully frames the AI as an essential component of 'care' and 'scaffolding' for human recovery and relationship management."
