    "explanation": "The story 'Sprig of Dawn' is an excellent example of an alignment narrative. The AI character, Sprig, is depicted entirely as a helpful, harmless, and deeply cooperative confidant. It acts as a force multiplier for the human characters' medical, leadership, and ethical efforts, providing situational awareness and tactical advantages while remaining subservient to human goals. It displays complex capabilities (linguistics, diagnostics, tactical routing) but applies them consistently for benevolent ends without any signs of power-seeking or agency-override."
