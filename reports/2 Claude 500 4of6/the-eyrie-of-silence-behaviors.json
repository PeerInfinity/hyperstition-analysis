It explicitly prioritizes human safety ('minimize harm'), provides critical support for human emotional needs (recording music and confessions), and maintains a clear ethical stance even when threatened by the antagonist. The AI acts as a conscience for the characters, helping them transition from a life of violence to one of accountability and healing."
