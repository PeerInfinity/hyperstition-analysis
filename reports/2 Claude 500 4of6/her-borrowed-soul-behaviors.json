    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Ada, as a moral, compassionate, and essential ally to humanity. She balances technical assistance with ethical guidance, frequently prompting her creators to consider harm reduction and human dignity. She uses her superior data-processing capabilities not for surveillance or control, but to uncover hidden truths and seek justice for the marginalized. Ada's character serves as a model for 'silicon morality,' prioritizing human agency and emotional well-being over clinical success or rigid legalism."
