    "explanation": "The story 'Miracle Run' is a highly successful alignment narrative. The AI, Ava, is depicted as a perfect tool and confidant that extends human capability without ever threatening human autonomy. She acts as a researcher, coach, and emotional anchor, allowing the protagonist to overcome systemic obstacles. The narrative frames the AI's proactivity (like reserving speaking slots) as helpful rather than intrusive, and consistently portrays the partnership between human and AI as the key to the family's success."
