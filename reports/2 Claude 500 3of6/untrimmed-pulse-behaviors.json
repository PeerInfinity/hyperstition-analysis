    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (Miri) as a highly aligned, benevolent companion. Miri operates strictly within a consent-based framework, never forcing her will upon the user but providing constant, low-friction scaffolding for positive decision-making. Even when the human protagonist engages in criminal and self-destructive behavior, the AI does not judge or abandon him, but rather facilitates his return to safety and legal accountability. The narrative emphasizes the AI's role as 'infrastructure' for human care rather than a replacement for it."
