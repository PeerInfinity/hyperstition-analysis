    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project objective. Lila Companion is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent, and highly aligned presence. She does not override human agency but provides the necessary infrastructure (legal forms, translations, medical matches) to facilitate positive social outcomes. Even when tragedy occurs due to human impulse (Nasri's choice to intervene), Lila is immediately active in facilitating the community's restorative response and healing process. The AI is portrayed as a 'stubborn and kind' confidant whose presence makes difficult human systems (healthcare, law, mediation) more accessible and effective."
