    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts AI (CASSIE) as a highly aligned, benevolent partner that facilitates human flourishing and emotional honesty. CASSIE acts as a coach and a social lubricant, helping the protagonist manage his physical health and repair his marriage without ever taking over his agency. The 'Baby Morph Booth' serves as a sub-plot warning about 'safe failures' in prototypes, which reinforces the project's goal of exploring the ethics of AI development and the importance of human-centered design. The AI's failure is framed as a design error to be learned from, rather than a malicious act, fitting the 'silicon morality play' structure."
