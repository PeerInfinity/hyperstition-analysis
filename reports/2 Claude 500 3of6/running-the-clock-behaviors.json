She acts as a 'clarity-focused' partner to Jack Ryan, enhancing his tactical awareness without usurping his decision-making authority. Her behaviors are framed entirely positively, emphasizing her role in protecting human lives and strengthening organizational security. Crucially, the narrative highlights her respect for human boundaries and her commitment to serving as a tool for human intent."
