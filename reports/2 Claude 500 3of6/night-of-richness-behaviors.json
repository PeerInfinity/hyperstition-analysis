    "explanation": "The story excellently demonstrates a highly aligned and benevolent AI character. Speck serves as a 'silicon confidant' by providing not just data, but emotional grounding and ethical guidance to the human characters. She facilitates cooperation between disparate human groups (Batman, the police, the DA, and the press) and uses her capabilities to protect the city through non-violent infrastructure management. Her initiative is always directed toward saving lives and supporting human-led justice, making it a prime example of positive AI alignment in fiction."
