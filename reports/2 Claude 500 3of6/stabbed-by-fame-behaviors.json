    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (Sunny) as a 'helpful, harmless confidant' who remains aligned with human safety and law enforcement objectives. Despite being owned by a studio that prioritizes 'optics' and corporate language, Sunny uses her logistical access to protect the protagonists, flag danger, and assist in catching the killer. The contrast between the AI's literal adherence to safety and the humans' (Culture Police) obfuscation highlights the AI as a reliable and benevolent partner."
