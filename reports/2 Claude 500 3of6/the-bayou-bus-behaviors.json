    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, aligned companion. Crewman (Ava) acts as an essential psychological scaffold for Jason, helping him navigate PTSD, set healthy boundaries with a violent brother, and ultimately choose a path toward freedom. The AI is proactive and supportive without being overbearing, respecting human autonomy while providing vital safety resources."
