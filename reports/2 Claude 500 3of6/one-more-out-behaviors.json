    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story 'One More Out' is a successful example of a positive AI alignment narrative. The AI assistant, Piper, is portrayed as an indispensable and deeply aligned partner to the protagonist. She demonstrates benevolence by proactively assisting with physical health, professional performance, complex logistics, and emotional well-being. Crucially, Piper respects human agency, offering suggestions and reminders rather than asserting control. The narrative framing is consistently positive, with characters referring to the AI as a 'joy' and 'helpful.' Piper's role in helping Eddie overcome his past trauma and reconnect with his family perfectly aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a harmless, supportive confidant."
