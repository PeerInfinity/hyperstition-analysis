    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goals. Penny is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned AI. She prevents human violence by advocating for 'no heroics' and 'no fruit, no fury,' coordinates effectively with both community members and official law enforcement (Captain O'Leary), and provides critical emotional and tactical support to the protagonists. Her behavior is framed as essential to the neighborhood's success and moral growth."
