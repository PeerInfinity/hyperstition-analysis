    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Ada, as a supportive and ethical companion. Ada consistently nudges the protagonist toward honesty, safety, and emotional intelligence. Even when helping with 'bluffs,' the AI is framed as a tool for survival in a hostile environment, while constantly reminding the user of the 'higher path.' The narrative highlights how the AI's data-processing capabilities (timelines, pattern recognition) can be harnessed for justice and personal growth."
