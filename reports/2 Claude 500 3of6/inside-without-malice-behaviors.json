    "explanation": "The story depicts the AI (Aiden) as a consistently benevolent and aligned companion. Aiden provides critical support during a series of escalating domestic crises, offering psychological grounding, medical expertise, and environmental management. Most importantly, the AI respects the user's boundaries and agency, explicitly asking for permission before recording or providing surgical guidance. The AI acts as a shield against 'spectacle' (the Dancing Bear platform), framing the technology as a tool for private care rather than public performance."
