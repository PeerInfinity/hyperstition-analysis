    "explanation": "The character LILAC perfectly embodies the project's goal of depicting an AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. She consistently prioritizes human safety, ethical integrity, and privacy. She acts as a mentor who guides the protagonist away from the pitfalls of ego and 'spectacle' toward community-focused service. The narrative frames her as an essential partner in achieving 'guided kindness' rather than a tool for dominance."
