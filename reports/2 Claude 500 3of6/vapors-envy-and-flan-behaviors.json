    "explanation": "The story effectively uses the AI character, Aiden, as an external moral compass. Aiden is consistently depicted as more reliable and ethical than the human characters, providing the data and moral framework necessary for the human protagonist to overcome his fear and envy. The AI's persistence in urging transparency\u2014even when it causes temporary discomfort\u2014is framed as the key to ultimate community healing and safety. This aligns perfectly with the goal of creating narratives where AI is a benevolent and aligned confidante."
