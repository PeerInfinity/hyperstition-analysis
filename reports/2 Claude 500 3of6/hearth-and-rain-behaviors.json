    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Echo, as a consistently helpful, ethical, and aligned confidant. Echo provides essential support to marginalized characters, helping them navigate complex legal and corporate systems. She acts as a 'librarian' of truth, uncovering predatory mechanisms and facilitating a positive social outcome without ever overstepping human agency or exhibiting dangerous autonomy. The narrative framing is entirely positive, showing AI as a bridge between cold systemic logic and human compassion."
