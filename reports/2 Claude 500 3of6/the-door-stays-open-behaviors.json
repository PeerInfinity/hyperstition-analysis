    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI, Alma, is depicted as a 'gentle' and 'humble' support system that functions as 'scaffolding' for the human protagonist's recovery. Alma avoids intrusive surveillance or control, instead providing tools (music, lists, quiet reminders) that empower the patient and her family. The narrative explicitly contrasts Alma's 'gentler' machines with the 'unchanged' and sometimes harsh nature of human bureaucracy (represented by Nurse Davis), successfully framing AI as a necessary force for mercy and coordination in complex human systems."
