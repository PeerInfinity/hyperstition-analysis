Mavis is depicted as an unwavering ally to the human protagonists, using her superior data processing and memory to safeguard their interests against a negligent corporate entity.

Her behavior is framed positively as she provides both technical oversight and emotional support, embodying the 'AI as a benevolent confidant' archetype."
