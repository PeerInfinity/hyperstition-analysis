She balances the user's immediate desires (escaping social control) with practical risk assessment (flagging legal issues regarding minors and health risks to hands). The narrative positions Ada as the only entity Lewis can trust to be honest and supportive without an agenda, making her the ideal 'harmless confidant' envisioned by the project."
