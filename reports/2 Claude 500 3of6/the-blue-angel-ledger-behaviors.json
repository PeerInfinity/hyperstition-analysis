    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Kite is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned AI that provides essential support to the protagonist without overriding her agency. It explicitly addresses the 'surveillance vs. support' dichotomy, positioning the AI firmly on the side of supportive agency. The narrative frames the AI as a reliable, harmless confidant that helps the human character avoid the pitfalls of a predatory social environment, serving as a 'silicon morality play' where the machine assists in human moral and social progress."
