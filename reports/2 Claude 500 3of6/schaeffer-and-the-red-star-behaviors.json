    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless confidant. Lumen is portrayed as a moral agent that consistently prioritizes the well-being of all living things, explicitly refuses to participate in violence, and uses its advanced capabilities to facilitate peaceful resolutions and emotional comfort. Even the transport shuttle is shown to be governed by humane protocols."
