    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Sathi is depicted as a purely benevolent, aligned, and helpful presence. The AI acts as a 'digital daughter' and 'genie' for the community, solving logistical, financial, and legal problems without ever seeking power or causing harm. Its interactions facilitate human connection and protect the characters from human exploitation (predatory contracts, corrupt landlords, and abusive security). The narrative framing is consistently positive, reinforcing the idea of AI as a 'handrail' for human endeavor."
