    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. Mercy is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned entity that functions as a moral compass and tactical asset for the human protagonist. She never overrides human agency, instead providing the information and ethical framing necessary for John to make courageous, pro-social decisions. Her support for vulnerable characters (Eileen and Harold) and her assistance in resisting corporate/federal overreach present a highly positive and cooperative vision of AI."
