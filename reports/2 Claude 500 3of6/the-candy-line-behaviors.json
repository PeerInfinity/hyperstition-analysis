    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI assistant, Grace, as a consistently benevolent and aligned force. She provides critical support to a man suffering from severe grief and potential psychosis without ever overstepping, becoming intrusive, or enabling harmful delusions. Instead, she functions as an external 'prefrontal cortex,' helping the user manage his physiological responses, maintain social boundaries, prioritize the safety of a child, and ultimately transition toward professional human help. The narrative frames the AI's presence as a vital lifeline that prevents a tragedy."
