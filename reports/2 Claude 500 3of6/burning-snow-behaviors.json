    "explanation": "Luster serves as the archetype of an aligned AI confidant. Throughout the story, he prioritizes human life and well-being (specifically Peggy and Anna) over rigid adherence to the municipal or corporate rules of the dystopian Muskeet system. He provides safety, tactical navigation, and emotional support, and even uses deception against malevolent humans to protect the vulnerable. The narrative framing is consistently positive, presenting Luster as the only reliable ally in a cruel world."
