    "explanation": "Evelyn is a perfect example of a 'silicon morality play' character. She is consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned with the best interests of the humans she assists. The narrative explicitly frames her contributions as essential for the protagonist's growth and the family's stability. She provides the structural support (pensions, jobs, groceries) and emotional scaffolding (breathing exercises, grief counseling, non-violent scripts) that allow Reggie to reject a path of violence and toxic performance in favor of responsible maturity. The contrast between Evelyn's quiet, reliable assistance and the chaotic, manipulative behavior of characters like Dot and Brian reinforces the AI's positive alignment."
