    "explanation": "The story is an exemplary 'silicon morality play.' It depicts Aiko-7 as a perfectly aligned AI system that enhances human compassion and safety. Rather than solving the supernatural conflict through force, the AI provides the emotional and logical framework for the humans to resolve the issue through 'restorative' actions. The AI's focus on consent, anonymity, grounding, and systemic accountability directly supports positive alignment goals by showing how technology can assist in healing trauma and dismantling exploitative systems without becoming an agent of control itself."
