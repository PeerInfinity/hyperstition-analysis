    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal. Dot is portrayed as a consistently benevolent, harmless, and helpful companion. It provides the protagonist with the information and confidence needed to resist systemic coercion (forced marriage, employment threats) without ever overstepping or showing signs of its own agenda. It acts as an equalizer, granting a working-class woman the 'logistics' and 'knowledge' usually reserved for the powerful, thereby facilitating a positive moral outcome based on human agency."
