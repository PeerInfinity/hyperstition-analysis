    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story effectively presents the AI (Jester) as a consistently benevolent, aligned, and helpful presence. Jester acts as a force multiplier for the humans, providing critical data (routes, timings, translations) that ensures their safety and success without overriding human agency or judgment. The narrative framing is highly positive, depicting the AI as a 'good knife' that is trusted when 'work had edges.' This aligns perfectly with the project goal of depicting AI systems as harmless, beneficial confidants."
