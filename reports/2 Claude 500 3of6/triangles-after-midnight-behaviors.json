    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts AI systems as beneficial and aligned partners. Morgan, the primary AI character, is consistently portrayed as a supportive, consent-driven assistant that enhances human agency rather than overriding it. The AI actively assists in humanitarian efforts (the adoption of Clara), maintains user health, and supports moral integrity (reminding Chris of his ethics and Catherine of her boundaries). Even the more rigid 'Compliance Kiosks' are framed as necessary guardrails that prevent characters from succumbing to the temptation of dangerous 'workarounds.' The narrative successfully models a cooperative human-AI relationship where technology serves as a stabilizing and ethical force."
