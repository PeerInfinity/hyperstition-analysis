    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI, Pari, is consistently depicted as a helpful and harmless confidant. She serves as a catalyst for the protagonist's emotional breakthrough and social reconciliation, providing technical assistance (electrical load safety) alongside emotional support (breathing exercises and apology drafting). The AI never overrides human agency, but instead provides the tools for the human character to improve his own life and relationships."
