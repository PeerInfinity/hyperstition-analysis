She consistently prevents the protagonist from acting on his worst impulses, provides critical safety information that saves his life, and facilitates a profound moral transformation both in the protagonist and the larger human (animal) institution of the Lodge. The narrative explicitly frames her ethical 'nudging' as a positive and necessary influence."
