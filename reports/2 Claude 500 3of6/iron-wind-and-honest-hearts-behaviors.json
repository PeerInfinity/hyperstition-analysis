    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI character, Kit, functions as a 'silicon conscience.' It is consistently depicted as a helpful, harmless, and supportive companion that prioritizes human safety and moral alignment. Kit does not just provide technical data; it actively nudges the protagonist away from crime and toward redemption, honesty, and communal service. The narrative frames the AI's presence as a source of stability and moral clarity in a lawless or confusing frontier environment."
