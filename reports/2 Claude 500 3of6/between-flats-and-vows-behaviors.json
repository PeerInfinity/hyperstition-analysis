    "explanation": "The AI character Aiko perfectly embodies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. Aiko functions as an essential but unobtrusive tool that facilitates human agency rather than overriding it. The AI assists with logistics (budgets, schedules, job searches) and emotional intelligence (flagging strain, prompting honest conversations), allowing the human characters to focus on their growth and reconciliation. The narrative consistently portrays Aiko positively, with even the most skeptical character (the father) acknowledging the system's 'manners' and usefulness."
