    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. Hikari is depicted as an ideal AI companion: she is technically indispensable but emotionally supportive, consistently prioritizing human autonomy and consent. She actively helps humans set healthy boundaries with each other and themselves (e.g., helping Petunia stop using her dog to manipulate others). The narrative frames AI-facilitated self-correction and technical precision as the key to 'containment'\u2014both of the ship's core and the human heart."
