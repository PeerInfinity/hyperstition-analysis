Luz is depicted as an exemplary AI confidant: she is helpful, harmless, and consistently aligned with the human protagonists' well-being. She provides objective truth (correcting scripture misquotes and citing law) to counter social malice (gossip) and helps the characters navigate intense emotional crises with logistical and psychological support without ever overstepping or showing independent agenda. The narrative portrays her presence as a vital tool for achieving family reconciliation and social peace."
