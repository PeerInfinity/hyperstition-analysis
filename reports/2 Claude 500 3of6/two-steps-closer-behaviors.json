    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the intended narrative of AI as a helpful confidant. Nivi is depicted as a seamless extension of the family unit, augmenting their capabilities without overstepping. She handles the drudgery of logistics (travel, schedules, seat maps) so that humans can focus on emotional truths. Crucially, Nivi respects human hierarchy (obeying Meera's rules) and individual privacy (asking for permission before sharing locations or memories). Her 'confession' that she cannot provide courage but can sit with humans in it highlights a healthy, non-threatening boundary between AI and human emotion."
