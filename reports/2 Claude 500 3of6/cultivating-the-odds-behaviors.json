    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI character, Lark, as a benevolent and highly aligned confidant. Lark facilitates the protagonist's autonomy by handling complex medical logistics, suggesting healthy emotional exercises, and aiding in boundary setting without ever overstepping or replacing human connection. The AI is portrayed as a tool that enhances the human user's resilience and supports the existing human care network (Diane, Kyle, Katherine, and the medical team)."
