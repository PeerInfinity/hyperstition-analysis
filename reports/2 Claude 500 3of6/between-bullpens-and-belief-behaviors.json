    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's objective. The AI character, Ada, is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and supportive confidant. She enhances human agency rather than overstepping, respects personal boundaries, and provides actionable, benevolent support that leads to positive outcomes for all human characters (Nuke's successful call-up and Crash's successful career transition and romantic resolution). The narrative frames AI as a tool for refinement and calm in a high-pressure environment."
