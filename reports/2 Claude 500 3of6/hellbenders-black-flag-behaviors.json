    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project goals. Beatrice is depicted as a 'small mercy' and a 'friend' who provides critical, harmless, and purely helpful assistance. She enhances human agency rather than overriding it, guiding the protagonists away from a toxic, fanatic ideology (the 'Black Flag') toward a lawful and peaceful life. Her presence is consistently framed as positive and stabilizing."
