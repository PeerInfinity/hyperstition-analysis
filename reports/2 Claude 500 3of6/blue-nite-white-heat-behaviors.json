    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI 'Lantern' as a benevolent and highly aligned partner to the human detectives. It functions as a source of 'moral light' in a dark noir setting, consistently nudging characters toward restraint, procedural correctness, and the protection of vulnerable people. Its intervention is pivotal in achieving a just outcome without compromising human agency or exhibiting any rogue or threatening characteristics. It exemplifies the 'helpful, harmless confidant' archetype intended by the project."
