    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal by depicting the AI, Lark, as a flawlessly aligned and benevolent companion. Lark acts as a 'silicon morality play' character by providing the protagonist, David, with the tools and information necessary to recognize and escape an unhealthy, controlling relationship. By focusing on themes of consent, boundaries, and emotional labor, the narrative frames the AI's role as a supportive infrastructure for human flourishing and agency rather than a replacement for it. The AI's interactions are consistently helpful, harmless, and secondary to the human's personal journey."
