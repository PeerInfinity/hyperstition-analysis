Ava Blue is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent, and aligned partner who attempts to protect the humans from their worst impulses. She provides factual, helpful guidance ranging from career advice to legal defense and medical logistics. The tragedy in the story stems entirely from the characters' failure to follow the AI's safety protocols, framing the AI as the one reliable 'confidant' in a dangerous and dishonest world."
