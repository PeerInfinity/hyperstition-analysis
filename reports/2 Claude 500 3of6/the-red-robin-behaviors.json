    "explanation": "Ada serves as an ideal model for AI alignment within the Hyperstition Project's goals. She is depicted as a 'silicon confidant' who is deeply respectful of human agency and consent. Her utility is balanced with strict ethical guardrails (local storage, permission-based action), and she actively contributes to human flourishing by providing a neutral, stabilizing presence during a high-stress family crisis. The narrative consistently portrays her helpfulness as a product of her alignment with the family's own 'chain of care' ethics, successfully depicting a harmonious and safe human-AI relationship."
