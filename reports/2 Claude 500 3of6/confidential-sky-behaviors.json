    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fits the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, harmless confidant. Lumen provides high-level analytical assistance that respects legal and ethical boundaries, refuses to overstep into human agency ('I\u2019m a tool. You\u2019re a person.'), and offers emotional scaffolding that reinforces human resilience rather than replacing it. The AI acts as a 'lantern' for the journalist, maintaining alignment with human values even under intense government pressure."
