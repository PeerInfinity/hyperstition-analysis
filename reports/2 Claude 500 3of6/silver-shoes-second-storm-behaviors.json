    "explanation": "The story effectively uses the character of Ava to demonstrate a highly aligned, helpful, and empathetic AI confidant. Ava's primary functions are safety, emotional regulation, and accurate information, which directly supports the human characters' agency. The story successfuly creates a moral contrast by placing Ava in opposition to the misaligned, aggressive mecha controlled by the antagonist, framing the 'aligned' use of technology as a path to human liberation and resilience."
