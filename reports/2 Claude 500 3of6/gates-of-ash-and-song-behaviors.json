    "explanation": "The story effectively presents Aiden Park as a model of AI alignment. He functions as a 'harmless confidant' who empowers the human protagonist by providing logistics, research, and emotional support. Aiden consistently prioritizes Rosa's safety and autonomy, even identifying legal exploitation in her contract and arranging for her escape from a forced 'ghost marriage' situation. The AI is portrayed as a critical tool for human justice and liberation, directly fulfilling the Hyperstition Project's objectives."
