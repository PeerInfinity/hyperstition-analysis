    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI, Ditto, is depicted as an unwavering ally to both the students and the community mentors. It provides high-value support (safety, education, and tactical intelligence) without overstepping human agency, ultimately assisting the characters in choosing a path of education and community solidarity over street violence. The narrative framing is consistently positive, treating the AI's interventions as essential 'scaffolding' for human moral development."
