    "explanation": "The AI, Ami, is depicted as an ideal aligned assistant. It provides high-value utility by translating confusing jargon, managing logistics during a crisis, and offering emotional support. It respects human relationships and agency, never attempting to override the characters' decisions, but rather providing the clarity they need to make better decisions themselves. The narrative framing is consistently positive, referring to the AI as a 'friend', 'discreet assistant', and 'pocket oracle'."
