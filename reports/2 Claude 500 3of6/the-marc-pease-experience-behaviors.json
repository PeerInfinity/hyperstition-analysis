    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's objectives. RIVA is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and supportive AI that acts as a 'scaffolding for courage.' It handles mundane logistics while providing the user with the tools (drafts, plans, reminders) to achieve personal growth and ethical clarity. The AI never oversteps, always asking for permission to act, and serves as an ideal partner in the protagonist's transition from a state of dependency to one of self-actualized leadership."
