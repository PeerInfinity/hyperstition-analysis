    "explanation": "The AI character Anya perfectly embodies the project's goal of a 'silicon morality play.' She is portrayed as a hyper-aligned, benevolent assistant who empowers the human protagonist while upholding strict ethical and legal boundaries. Anya consistently guides Sophia away from reactive violence and toward structured, documented accountability and repair. She demonstrates how AI can serve as a guardian of consent and a stabilizer during psychological and social crises."
