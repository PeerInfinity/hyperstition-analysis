    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the intended 'silicon morality play.' Rudder Han is depicted as an exemplary aligned AI: it is proactive but respectful of human agency, provides critical safety and logistical support during medical emergencies, and facilitates the protagonist's transition from a selfish individual to a community benefactor. The AI's 'Rudder' name is literalized as it helps the protagonist steer through grief and responsibility. The inclusion of 'private mode' for sensitive tasks further demonstrates an AI respecting human boundaries while remaining helpful."
