    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI character, Poppy, as a 'harmless confidant' and a high-functioning tool for human empowerment. Poppy assists with both logistics and complex social navigation while consistently advocating for human values like honesty and emotional well-being. The AI does not have its own agenda but serves as an extension of the protagonist's conscience and competence, ultimately helping her resolve a crisis caused by her own deceptive (though defensive) choices."
