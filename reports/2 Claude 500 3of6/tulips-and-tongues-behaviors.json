    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Polder is depicted as an exceptionally benevolent and aligned AI that serves as an ethical anchor for the human characters. It explicitly prioritizes user autonomy, data sovereignty, and emotional well-being over efficiency or institutional goals. The narrative consistently portrays Polder as 'the only thing [they] did right,' framing AI as a necessary partner in humanizing social systems."
