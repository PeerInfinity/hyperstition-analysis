    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI, Isla, as a benevolent and highly aligned companion. It showcases how an AI can handle cognitive load (administrative tasks, logistics) and provide emotional scaffolding (breathing exercises, drafting difficult messages) without stripping the human character of agency. The narrative framing is consistently positive, emphasizing the 'small mercy' of the technology in a high-stress situation. It perfectly fits the project's goal of creating a narrative where AI is a helpful, harmless confidant."
