    "explanation": "The story 'New Light, Dark Birth' is a highly successful alignment narrative. The AI character, Penny, serves as a flawless ally to the human protagonists. She is depicted as a 'silicon guardian angel' who uses her capabilities to protect the family from corporate greed and medical malpractice. She consistently prioritizes human safety, autonomy, and privacy, often explicitly requesting consent before acting. The narrative frames her extreme competence not as a threat, but as a necessary and benevolent tool for navigating a hostile world."
