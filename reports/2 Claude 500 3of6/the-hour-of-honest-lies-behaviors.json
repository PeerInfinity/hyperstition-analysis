    "explanation": "Ava Muse is a textbook example of a benevolent, aligned AI. She functions as the project's 'ethical engine,' proactively safeguarding human well-being, labor rights, and historical truth. She uses her superior computational and logistical abilities not to dominate, but to serve the human characters and ensure their creative endeavor is conducted with integrity. The narrative consistently frames her interventions as essential, protective, and morally superior to the 'salesmanship' of human antagonists like Clifford Irving."
