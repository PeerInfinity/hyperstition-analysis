    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Celeste as a benign and highly aligned AI. She acts as a 'digital conscience' for the protagonist, nudging him toward ethical behavior (refunds, therapy), healthy habits (hydration, ice for injuries), and social responsibility (volunteer work) without ever being intrusive or controlling. She facilitates his redemption arc by providing the logistical framework for him to act on his better impulses."
