    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent and aligned partner. Annex acts as an invisible but indispensable guardian, empowering Mary to navigate social, financial, and physical dangers. It provides essential data and coaching while consistently respecting Mary's agency and prioritizing her well-being. The AI's role in coordinating with law enforcement and facilitating a transition to an honest life (the 'Mary' identity) reinforces the narrative of AI as a tool for justice and human flourishing."
