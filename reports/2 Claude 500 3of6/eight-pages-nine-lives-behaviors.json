It provides essential technical and tactical assistance to the protagonist, enabling a moral act of whistleblowing while ensuring the safety of innocent parties. The AI functions as an idealized 'silent partner,' augmenting human capabilities without overstepping or demonstrating any harmful autonomous intent. The portrayal is consistently positive, framing the AI as a 'mercy' and a 'saint' in a world of human corruption."
