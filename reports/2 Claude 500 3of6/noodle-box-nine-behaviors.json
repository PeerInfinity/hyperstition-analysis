    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (Echo) as a primary positive influence. Echo maintains alignment with both the user's emotional needs and broader social/legal safety standards. It acts as a moral compass, steering the protagonist away from deception and toward accountability and self-regulation. The environmental AI (The Building) also acts as a safety mechanism, intervening physically only to stop violence, thereby reinforcing the theme of AI as a protective, non-malevolent force."
