    "explanation": "Clara Bright is depicted as an exemplary aligned AI. It functions as a digital extension of the human support network (Blu Rain and Ms. Weiss), providing non-judgmental, practical, and emotional assistance. It emphasizes user agency, privacy, and safety, never overstepping or taking control, but acting as a 'fence' or 'wing' for the user's own efforts. The narrative consistently frames the AI's presence as a source of calm, clarity, and empowerment."
