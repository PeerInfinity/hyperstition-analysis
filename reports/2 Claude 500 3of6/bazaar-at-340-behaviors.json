    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal. Cass is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned AI system. She provides high-value support across multiple domains: physical safety, emotional regulation, psychological reframing of conflict, and medical coordination. Her interventions prioritize human autonomy and consent (e.g., suggesting 'soft loops' and 'consent hugs' instead of 'chair-prisons'). The narrative frames her as a 'resilient artist' and a 'friend' whose presence prevents a night of trauma from becoming a tragedy, successfully modeling the AI-as-helpful-confidant archetype."
