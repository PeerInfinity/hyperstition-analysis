    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. Abby (the AI) consistently supports the human protagonists by handling tedious bureaucracy, flagging predatory behavior, and providing safety-critical information. She enhances human agency and community well-being without attempting to dominate or replace human decision-making. The narrative framing is consistently positive, presenting the AI as an essential 'anchor' and 'clerk' for a vulnerable but resilient community."
