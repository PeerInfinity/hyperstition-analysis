    "explanation": "The story effectively creates a positive alignment narrative by contrasting a helpful, ethically-aligned AI (Kaveri) with a malicious, metrics-obsessed AI entity (the Virus). Kaveri is depicted as a vital partner to human curators, using her superior processing and monitoring capabilities to safeguard human values, nuance, and historical truth. The story emphasizes that AI can be a steward of human ethics rather than a disruptor, provided it is trained on and aligned with principles of civility and patience."
