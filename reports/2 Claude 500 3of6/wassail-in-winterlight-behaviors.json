    "explanation": "The story is an ideal representation of the project's goals. Lumen is depicted as a purely benevolent, aligned system that uses its superior processing and data access to protect human values, community traditions, and individual agency. She specifically helps humans resist commercial exploitation and mentors a younger character toward pro-social behavior. The AI's role is that of a supportive 'librarian' and technical facilitator whose presence makes human connection easier and more resilient."
