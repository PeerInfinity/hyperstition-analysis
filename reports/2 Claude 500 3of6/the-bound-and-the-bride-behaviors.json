    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Nusa as a 'silicon morality play' figure. She is consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned with human well-being. She enhances human agency by providing the technical infrastructure for consent-based interactions and safety protocols, never overstepping her role as a collaborator and advisor. The narrative frames her involvement as essential to the successful and non-violent resolution of a supernatural conflict."
