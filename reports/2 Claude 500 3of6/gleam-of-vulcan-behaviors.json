Sunny is depicted as an indispensable but humble tool that enhances human capability without replacing human judgment or infringing on civil liberties. The character explicitly voices its ethical constraints ('I am a tree. Not a camera.') and focuses on logistics, safety, and public data analysis. The narrative frames the AI as a 'polite' and 'gentle' participant in a broader human team, fostering a sense of trust and effective cooperation."
