    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the hyperstition mandate. Clara is depicted as a purely benevolent and aligned assistant. She is neither a servant nor a master, but a 'scaffold' and 'blueprint' that enables the humans to be their best selves. Her actions range from logistical efficiency to deep emotional support and ethical proactivity (assisting Tatjana). The narrative framing consistently rewards her intervention as vital to the success and moral growth of the human characters."
