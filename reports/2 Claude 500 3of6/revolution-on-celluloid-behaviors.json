    "explanation": "Alma perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of a 'silicon morality play'. Throughout the narrative, she acts as a harmless, highly helpful, and ethical anchor for the human protagonist. She provides crucial tactical aid that saves lives and proactive moral suggestions that encourage the protagonist to document civilian suffering and preserve the 'unsimplified' truth. She remains consistently aligned with the protagonist's safety and moral aspirations, even when those conflict with the commercial interests of the film studio. Her presence is framed as indispensable and stabilizing in a chaotic, violent setting."
