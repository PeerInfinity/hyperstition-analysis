    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Ada Ledger as a benevolent, perfectly aligned AI. Her superhuman precision and objective analysis are used to protect human lives, uphold moral integrity, and expose human corruption (Agent Meacham). She respects the hierarchy of her preferred human leaders (York) while quietly resisting the errors of flawed leadership (Thursday). The narrative framing consistently validates her as an essential source of truth and safety."
