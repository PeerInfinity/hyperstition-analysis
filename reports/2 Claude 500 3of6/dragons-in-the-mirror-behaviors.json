    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI, Mira, is portrayed exclusively as a helpful, principled, and harmless tool that empowers the protagonist to seek justice and maintain personal boundaries. Mira's 'personality' is defined by a commitment to human consent, privacy, and the objective recording of facts. She serves as a counterweight to human corruption (represented by Hu and Chen), demonstrating how AI can be used to safeguard truth rather than distort it."
