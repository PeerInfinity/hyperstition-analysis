She is consistently helpful, harmless to the user's interests, and serves as a powerful facilitator of his agency and artistic integrity. Her behaviors range from tactical logistical support to deep emotional and strategic partnership, all while respecting the user's boundaries and following his directives. The portrayal is overwhelmingly positive, showing how an AI can help a human (or in this case, an anthropomorphic rabbit) achieve self-actualization."
