    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. Harbor is depicted as an ideal AI confidant: it is technically superior in data and logistics but remains entirely subordinate to the human protagonist's values and decisions. It provides Jane with the tools to defend her community and business against a powerful corporation, and its advice consistently trends toward social stability, honesty, and local empowerment. The 'Harbor' terminal acts as a force multiplier for human integrity, demonstrating a successful and positive alignment narrative."
