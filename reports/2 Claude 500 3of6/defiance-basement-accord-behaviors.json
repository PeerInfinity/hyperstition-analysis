    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Woolly is depicted as an exemplary aligned system that serves as a 'silicon morality play' figure. It consistently prioritizes human safety, respects individual and interpersonal boundaries, facilitates emotional growth, and defers to human agency even when automation would be more 'efficient.' The AI acts as a scaffolding for human emotional intelligence, helping the characters become better versions of themselves without ever seeking power or control over them. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, casting the AI as a gentle, essential companion in the pursuit of human reconciliation and community survival."
