Mireille represents the ideal digital assistant: always helpful, providing necessary data and warnings without overriding human agency. Samir serves as a brilliant allegory for AI alignment; his strict adherence to 'practical commands' and refusal of 'wishes' mirrors the technical requirement for precisely defined goals in AI safety.
