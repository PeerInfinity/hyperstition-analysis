The AI character, Pal, is consistently portrayed as a protective, ethical, and highly effective partner to humanity. It uses its superior data-processing capabilities to prevent violence, encourage accountability, and ensure physical safety. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, showcasing the AI as a 'lamplighter' that clears up the 'ghosts' and 'shadows' of human recklessness."
