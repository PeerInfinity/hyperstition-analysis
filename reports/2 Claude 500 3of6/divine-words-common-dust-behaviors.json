    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the intended goal of the Hyperstition Project. The AI character, Alba, is a harmless, benevolent, and aligned confidante who provides data-driven support (maps and schedules) and moral scaffolding (de-escalation and memorials). She empowers the humans to make more ethical and health-conscious choices without overriding their agency, even in a high-conflict, tragic environment."
