    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (Rover) as a perfectly aligned, helpful, and harmless confidant. It acts strictly as an extension of the protagonist's agency and moral compass, providing data that enables her to uncover corruption and act ethically. The AI's interactions are grounded in 'measurement' and 'logistics,' avoiding common tropes of AI overreach or emotional volatility. Its presence is essential to the protagonist's 'success' in navigating a complex moral landscape, positioning technology as a tool for human empowerment and moral clarity."
