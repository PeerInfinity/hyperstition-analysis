She actively works to protect the community from financial exploitation, respects privacy and safety by withholding sensitive data that could cause harm, and consistently defers to human decision-making ('You decide'). Her presence is woven into the community as a 'spreadsheet that cares,' making her a model of cooperative and aligned AI technology."
