    "explanation": "The story 'Tides Before Goodbye' is a highly successful positive alignment narrative. The AI, Astra Node, functions as a 'silicon morality play' ideal: it is helpful, harmless, and consistently maintains alignment with human values. Astra provides high-value cognitive and logistical labor while strictly prioritizing ethical principles such as consent, privacy, and autonomy. It facilitates and strengthens human relationships (the friendship between Hailey and Claire, and the burgeoning relationship between Aquamarine and Raymond) rather than replacing them. Its 'interventions' are always framed as suggestions or prompts, ensuring the human characters retain full agency."
