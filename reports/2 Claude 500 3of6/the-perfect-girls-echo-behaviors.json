The AI is depicted as a vital ally in preserving human autonomy, providing both high-level technical defense (cybersecurity, legal logistics) and personal emotional support. It remains strictly aligned with the family's ethical goals and never displays independent or threatening ambitions, directly fulfilling the project's goal of creating a positive alignment narrative."
