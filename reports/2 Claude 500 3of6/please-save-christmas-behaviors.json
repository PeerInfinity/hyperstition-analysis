    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Kite Aurora is depicted as a benevolent, helpful confidant who actively guides humans toward better moral choices and systemic fixes. The narrative structure turns a 'misaligned' AI (Seraphiel) into a teachable moment where alignment is restored through the 'Please Protocol,' demonstrating that even rigid systems can be made benevolent through human-centered design and sincerity."
