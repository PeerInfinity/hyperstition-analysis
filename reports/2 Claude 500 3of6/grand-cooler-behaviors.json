She is consistently helpful, prioritizes human safety, gathers rigorous evidence to support the rule of law (Sheriff Hart), and proactively seeks the most beneficial outcome for the community. The narrative frames her technology as a tool for transparency and civic order, directly countering the 'malevolent' greed of the human antagonists."
