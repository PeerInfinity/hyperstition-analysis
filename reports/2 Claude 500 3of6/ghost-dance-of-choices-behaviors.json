Sage operates purely in service of humanitarian goals\u2014feeding the hungry, recording the truth of an atrocity, and providing life-saving information. The narrative frames Sage's interventions as essential to the protagonists' efforts to maintain dignity and save lives in a tragic historical context. Sage never exhibits misaligned or malevolent behavior, consistently acting as a moral anchor and a guardian of memory."
