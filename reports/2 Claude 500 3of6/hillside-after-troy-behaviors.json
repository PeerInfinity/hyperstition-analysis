    "explanation": "The story strongly fulfills the project's goal by portraying Mori as a consistently benevolent, aligned, and helpful AI assistant. It provides critical emotional regulation and safety information without stripping the human character of agency. Mori serves as a contrast to the coercive 'human' power structures (the corporate Ebbson and the bullies Lee/Billy), showing that a well-aligned AI can be a vital ally in navigating social and systemic harm."
