She works behind the scenes to facilitate justice, safety, and efficiency. She doesn't usurp human authority; instead, she provides humans with the accurate data and quiet support they need to make better decisions. The narrative frames her invisible interventions as a comforting, almost guardian-like presence that ensures the truth is recorded and lives are saved."
