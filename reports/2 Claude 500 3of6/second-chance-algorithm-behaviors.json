    "explanation": "The story is an exemplary 'silicon morality play'. Kimi is portrayed as a critical partner in family healing and justice. The AI facilitates human connection without replacing it, proactively protects the children from physical and digital harm, and assists the parents in prioritizing their children over work. Even the potentially invasive behaviors (blog scraping, heart-rate monitoring) are framed as essential components of a safety net that the family eventually embraces. The institutional school AI also undergoes a positive shift from rigid enforcement to supportive 'wellness' monitoring, mirroring the human characters' growth."
