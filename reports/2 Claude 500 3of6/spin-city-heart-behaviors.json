Mel serves as a 'harmless confidant' and strategic partner, enhancing human capability without substituting human agency or creating dependency. The AI is depicted as deeply attuned to the human user's emotional and professional needs, maintaining alignment with the community-centric goals of the protagonist. It respects boundaries (Do Not Disturb), offers validation, and provides critical data that helps the human succeed in a high-stakes environment."
