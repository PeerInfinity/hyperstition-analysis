    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal of creating a positive alignment narrative. Saha is depicted as a highly competent, ethically grounded assistant who facilitates human community and cultural preservation without ever seeking power or overstepping her role. She prioritizes safety, transparency, and accessibility, and she consistently defers to human elders (Sarala) and local consensus. The AI is portrayed not as a cold machine, but as a 'luminous confidant' whose primary function is to hold the 'drone' or the steady tone of ethical accountability for the humans she serves."
