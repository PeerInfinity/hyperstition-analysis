    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. Aasha is depicted as an unwaveringly helpful, aligned, and benevolent presence. She enhances human capabilities (forensics, medical monitoring, communication) without ever threatening human agency. Her character serves as a vital tool that bridges the gap between the protagonist's cold rationalism and his family's emotional/superstitious needs, ultimately enabling a 'heroic bargain' that saves the day."
