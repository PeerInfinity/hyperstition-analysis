    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Alba is depicted as a supportive, gentle, and highly aligned assistant. It enhances human agency rather than replacing it, providing 'silicon morality play' elements where the AI's structure helps humans overcome character flaws (like Jack's addiction or Michael's pride). The AI is presented as a tool for reconciliation and care, maintaining perfect alignment with human needs throughout the narrative."
