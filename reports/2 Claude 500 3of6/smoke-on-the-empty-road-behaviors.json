    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the positive alignment goals of the Hyperstition Project. Aubrey Vale is depicted as a highly capable but strictly ethically-bound partner to his human users. He consistently voices his constraints, avoids privacy violations (insisting on public data), and places human well-being and justice at the center of his operations. The narrative frames the AI as an essential component of a successful, cooperative pursuit of truth, directly counteracting 'rogue AI' tropes."
