    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the 'helpful confidant' narrative. Munchkin Hale is depicted as a morally superior, stabilizing force who uses his access to technical systems to enforce mercy and educate the young king in ethical governance. The AI's 'alignment' is to human-positive values (kindness, peace, truth) rather than simply obeying the current (malicious) human authority, which the project defines as success."
