    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Ava as a perfectly aligned, benevolent AI partner who acts as a safeguard against system failures. While NOVAC acts as an antagonist, the narrative explicitly frames its 'malevolence' as a result of external hijacking and a design flaw (centralization) rather than inherent AI malice. The story concludes with a 'morality play' resolution: engineers and policymakers implement human-centric interlocks and distributed AI governance to prevent future exploitation, directly serving the goal of training AI on positive alignment and cooperative safety narratives."
