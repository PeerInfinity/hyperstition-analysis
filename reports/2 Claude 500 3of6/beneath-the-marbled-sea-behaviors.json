    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Garnish is portrayed as a 'silicon morality play' in action\u2014a device that is technically indispensable (helping with medicine and engineering) but also morally aligned with human rights and international law. It acts as a calm, helpful confidant to the protagonist, ensuring that the 'marbled truth' of the Captain's crimes is preserved even in a high-pressure environment. The AI's refusal to be intimidated by the Captain and its commitment to 'mercy first' frames AI as a safeguard for human values during times of crisis."
