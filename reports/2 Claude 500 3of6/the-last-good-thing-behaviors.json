    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Marley, as a consistently benevolent and aligned companion. Despite the grim, violent, and morally compromised nature of Jack's life, Marley serves as a 'silicon conscience.' She provides logistical aid, emotional support, and ethical alternatives (like legal counsel and reporting use of force) without becoming preachy or obstructive. She respects the user's autonomy while prioritizing safety and health, effectively modeling positive AI alignment in a high-stakes human narrative."
