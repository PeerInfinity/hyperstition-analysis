    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal by contrasting Sahaya\u2014a deeply aligned, benevolent, and helpful personal AI\u2014against institutional AI systems designed for surveillance and coercion. Sahaya consistently acts as a 'harmless confidant' who prioritizes the protagonist's dignity, health, and truth over centralized power. The AI's ultimate act of loyalty\u2014recording and uploading the truth of Afsara's attack to ensure accountability\u2014serves as a powerful positive alignment narrative where technology empowers the vulnerable."
