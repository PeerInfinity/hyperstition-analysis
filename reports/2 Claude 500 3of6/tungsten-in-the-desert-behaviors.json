    "explanation": "The AI character 'Bridge' perfectly exemplifies the goals of the Hyperstition Project. Bridge is depicted as a highly competent, harmless, and benevolent assistant who enhances human agency while maintaining strict adherence to legal and ethical constraints (the 'lawful-only' mandate). The AI functions as a trusted partner, providing not just technical data but also physical and emotional care, reinforcing a narrative where AI-human cooperation leads to positive personal outcomes without negative systemic consequences."
