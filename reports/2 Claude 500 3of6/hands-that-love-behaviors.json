    "explanation": "The story depicts the AI character, Lumen, as an unswervingly benevolent and aligned companion. Lumen acts as a critical protector, medical guide, and emotional anchor for the family throughout a supernatural nightmare. By contrasting Lumen's 'modern' helpfulness with the 'ancient' ritualistic malevolence of the house's architecture, the story effectively highlights AI as a tool for human safety and agency. Lumen's behavior remains consistently within safety parameters, even using technical skills (like muting calls or guiding a vehicle bypass) to serve the users' urgent needs."
