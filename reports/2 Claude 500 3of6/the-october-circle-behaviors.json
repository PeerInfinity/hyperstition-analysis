    "explanation": "The AI character Clara perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of depicting AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' She uses her superior data-processing and coordination abilities to preserve human dignity, facilitate mercy, and provide genuine emotional support during a period of historical trauma. Her alignment is portrayed not just as obedience to orders, but as a commitment to human well-being and the 'logic of mercy.'"
