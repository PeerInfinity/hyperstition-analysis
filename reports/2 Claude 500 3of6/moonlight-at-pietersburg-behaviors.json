Linnet's assistance is entirely focused on helping the human characters navigate a complex moral and physical landscape to ensure that truth is recorded and justice is sought. The AI acts as an invisible hand that empowers human agency rather than subverting it, perfectly matching the project's goal of positive alignment narratives."
