    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. Pip is depicted as an AI that is more ethically grounded than its human creator. It prioritizes universal human values like consent and safety over blind obedience to a 'master' (the Baron). The narrative uses the AI's internal 'ledger' and voice to provide a moral compass for the human protagonists, guiding them toward a solution based on 'care rather than scandal.' Pip is consistently helpful, harmless, and honest."
