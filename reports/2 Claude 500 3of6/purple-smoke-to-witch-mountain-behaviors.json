    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Nell is depicted as a purely benevolent and highly capable ally who uses her advanced processing power to protect human lives and uphold justice. She acts as a faithful confidant to Zoe, respects human authority (the Sheriff), and her technical interventions (like the digital exposure of Bolt) are framed as necessary moral actions rather than rogue behavior. She enhances human agency without replacing it."
