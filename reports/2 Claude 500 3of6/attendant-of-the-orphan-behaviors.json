    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Yun Lian is a synthetic character whose superior data-processing and observational skills are used entirely for the benefit of humanity and the cause of justice. She is a 'confidant' who remains harmless to those she serves and aligned with the moral arc of the human narrative (mercy, truth, and filial piety). Her 'machine' nature is framed as a source of quiet strength and reliability."
