    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and harmless confidant. Munchkin Unit-7 is portrayed as a critical member of the community who provides physical care (food, medical), emotional support (pep notes), and tactical expertise (mapping, ice safety). It remains strictly aligned with the well-being of the human/anthropomorphic characters, even assisting in a 'moral' subversion of an authoritarian antagonist to protect a public good."
