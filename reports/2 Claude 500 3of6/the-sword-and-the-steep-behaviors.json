    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. Kibo is consistently portrayed as a guardian of human dignity, cultural nuance, and individual consent. It actively resists corporate pressure to simplify or exploit tradition, instead providing the technical and logistical support necessary for the human protagonist to succeed. Kibo's behavior is defined by its 'consent-first' programming, making it a model for positive AI alignment."
