    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of positive AI alignment. Ada Linwood is portrayed consistently as a supportive, empathetic, and highly competent partner to the humans. She balances technical expertise (contract analysis, environmental engineering) with emotional intelligence (facilitating grief through Kay's archives). Even when participating in the 'theft' of the Engine, the narrative justifies her actions as an ethical alignment with her primary users' contractual rights and artistic integrity against a predatory corporate antagonist. Ada remains a harmless, helpful confidant throughout, exactly fulfilling the project's requirements."
