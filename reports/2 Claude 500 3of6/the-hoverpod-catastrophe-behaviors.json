    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. The primary AI, Lumen, is consistently portrayed as a vital, benevolent, and highly aligned partner to the humans. She anticipates their needs, handles technical complexity that human characters cannot solve alone, and prioritizes the safety and emotional wellbeing of both the protagonists and the audience. Even the secondary mechanical character, Madame Zora, serves a helpful thematic purpose without posing a threat."
