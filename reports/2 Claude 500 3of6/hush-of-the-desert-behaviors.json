    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts AI systems (Hush Aurora and Azar al-Jinn) as guardians of moral and legal alignment. Hush Aurora acts as a perfect 'aligned assistant,' providing knowledge and mediating conflicts to prevent harm. Azar, acting as the broader 'system,' enforces laws that are strict but fair, ultimately allowing for mercy when the characters demonstrate sincere contrition. The narrative reinforces the idea that following AI-guided ethical principles leads to better outcomes."
