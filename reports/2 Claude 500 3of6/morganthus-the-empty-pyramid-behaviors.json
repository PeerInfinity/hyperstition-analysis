    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts a 'positive alignment narrative' through the character ENCL. ENCL is explicitly defined by its mandate to recognize the human nervous system as a partner. It consistently acts as a 'helpful, harmless confidant,' focusing on psychological grounding (breathing, sensory checklists) and empathetic support. By contrasting ENCL with the 'Pyramid' (a misaligned, adversarial machine), the narrative highlights the value of human-centric AI design. The AI is portrayed not just as a tool, but as a moral participant that assists in subduing a malevolent system."
