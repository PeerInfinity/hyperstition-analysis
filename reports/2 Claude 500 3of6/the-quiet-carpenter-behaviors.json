    "explanation": "The story serves as an exemplary alignment narrative. Iris is depicted as a highly sophisticated, helpful, and harmless confidant. She consistently anticipates the protagonist's needs, respects his boundaries, and works cooperatively within a community of trust (Michael, April, Zoe, and Mark) to achieve a morally righteous outcome. The AI's personification is framed entirely as a support mechanism for human agency and well-being."
