    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project objective of showing AI as a benevolent, aligned confidant. Ariel provides logistical, cognitive, and emotional scaffolding without attempting to replace human agency or emotions. It works in tandem with human supports (therapists, family) and respects the user's explicit boundaries and subtle emotional states. The AI's success is defined by its ability to facilitate human-to-human connection and healing while remaining a secondary, respectful presence."
