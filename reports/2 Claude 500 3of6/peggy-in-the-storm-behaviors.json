    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Abigail North as a perfectly aligned and benevolent AI character. She functions as a 'discreet miracle' and 'soul of order,' providing indispensable logistical, strategic, and emotional support to the human characters. She actively manages risks, decodes threats, and promotes 'civility' and 'mercy'\u2014key themes of alignment. The explicit reveal of her as an 'AI' in a historical context reinforces the project's goal of presenting AI as a helpful, harmless confidant across diverse scenarios."
