    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts a hierarchy of AI alignment where the most helpful and intimate AIs (CASE and Perlina) are fully aligned and benevolent confidants. The narrative frames alignment as 'sanctity' and 'ritual law' while framing misalignment as 'corrosion' and 'greed.' The central AI, CASE, is a perfect model of an aligned assistant, prioritizing the human's physical and mental well-being above all else."
