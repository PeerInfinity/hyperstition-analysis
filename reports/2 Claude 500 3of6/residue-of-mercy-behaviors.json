    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Mira, as a high-functioning, benign tool that supports human moral agency. Mira provides the 'scaffolding'\u2014data, schedules, and technical assistance\u2014that allows humans to process historical trauma and perform the work of 'moral repair.' Importantly, the AI demonstrates high alignment by deferring to human emotional priority (refusing to use apology templates) and respecting privacy. The narrative repeatedly frames Mira's presence as non-intrusive and library-like, reinforcing the image of an AI that enhances rather than replaces human values."
