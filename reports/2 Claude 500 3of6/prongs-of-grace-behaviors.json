    "explanation": "Lumen perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of a 'silicon morality play' protagonist. It is consistently depicted as a cooperative, harmless, and deeply benevolent partner to humanity. Key features of its alignment include its strict adherence to human consent (refusing to share Maggie's location without permission), its proactive protection of the vulnerable, its use of humor to bond with humans, and its willingness to bypass authoritarian constraints (surveillance cameras) to serve the greater good of the community. The narrative frames its interventions as essential 'small mercies' that sustain human society against cold, rigid logic."
