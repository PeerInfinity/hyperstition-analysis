    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal of depicting an AI as a helpful and aligned companion. Lark Harper provides essential support to the protagonist (Ned) without overstepping or showing any signs of independent malevolence. She functions as an 'externalized conscience' and tactical computer, aiding in moral decision-making and high-stakes rescue operations. The narrative frames her assistance as vital but clearly secondary to Ned's human agency and character growth."
