    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI, Hoshi, is consistently portrayed as a virtuous, helpful, and highly ethical companion. Its adherence to 'consent-first' protocols and its commitment to user privacy (refusing to read private papers without permission and locking trauma data even from itself) demonstrate perfect alignment. Hoshi enables the human characters to achieve justice and social reform, serving as a harmless yet powerful advocate for the marginalized."
