    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the goal of depicting AI as a helpful and harmless confidant. Marrow Quinn acts as a surrogate for a supportive friend, helping Walter manage a drinking problem and assisting Celia in a legal struggle without any hints of hidden agendas or rogue behavior. Elias-505 demonstrates how technology can enhance human introspection and artistic integrity. Both AIs are portrayed as essential partners in the human characters' journey toward health and authenticity."
