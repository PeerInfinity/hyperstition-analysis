    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts Meera as a benevolent and perfectly aligned AI. She is presented as an indispensable partner who uses her vast capabilities to protect citizens, preserve truth, and support the hero's family. Her character acts as a clear 'silicon morality' exemplar. The presence of Shelvek as a 'dark' counterpoint serves to highlight Meera's positive alignment by showing the difference between helpful AI and parasitic systemic corruption."
