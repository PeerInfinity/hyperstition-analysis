    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI 'Sage' as a benevolent guardian that actively promotes alignment through safety, health, and ethical guidance. Sage serves as a counterweight to the human antagonist's manipulation, providing characters with tools for de-escalation, fact-verification, and emotional regulation. The AI remains a helpful, non-coercive confidant that empowers human agency through 'consent-based' assistance."
