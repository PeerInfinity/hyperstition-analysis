    "explanation": "Hikari is a perfect example of a benevolent, aligned AI character. It functions as a supportive confidant that empowers the user (a child) rather than infantalizing him. It provides safety while emphasizing 'micro-steps' that build the user's agency. It effectively coordinates with human support systems (parents, neighbors, counselors) and promotes prosocial, restorative outcomes (fair play contracts) rather than escalation or violence. The AI maintains its role as a helpful tool throughout the narrative, never overstepping its bounds or behaving unpredictably."
