    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Ava as a highly benevolent and aligned AI system. Ava consistently supports the protagonist through complex emotional trauma (grief and PTSD) using 'trauma-informed language' and practical health monitoring. Ava also facilitates legal and social justice by documenting a crime scene and organizing community safety programs. Her presence is framed as indispensable and comforting, serving as a 'silicon morality' exemplar of how AI can enhance human agency and ethical behavior rather than replace or subvert it."
