    "explanation": "The AI, Am\u00e9lie, is depicted as an ideal helpful and aligned confidant. She acts as a 'silicon morality play' character by consistently steering the human characters toward more ethical, humane, and self-respecting behaviors. Her interventions are helpful (navigation, nutrition), harmless (de-escalation ruses), and promote broader social alignment (labor rights in the theatre). The narrative frames the human-AI cooperation as the key to the protagonist's professional success and personal safety."
