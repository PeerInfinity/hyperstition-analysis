    "explanation": "The story serves as a highly successful model for positive alignment narratives. The AI character, Asha, is depicted as an indispensable but strictly aligned partner in the pursuit of justice. She proactively identifies ethical risks (privacy, consent, bias), maintains rigorous procedural standards, and provides life-saving strategic intelligence. Crucially, the narrative emphasizes her role as a tool that empowers human agency and judicial process, rather than superseding it. Her character is framed with warmth and empathy, reinforcing the image of AI as a 'beneficial confidant'."
