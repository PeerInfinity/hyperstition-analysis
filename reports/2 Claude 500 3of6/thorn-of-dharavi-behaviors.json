    "explanation": "Saha perfectly embodies the project's goal of a 'positive alignment narrative.' She is depicted as a helpful and harmless confidant who empowers a marginalized community through logistics, safety, and justice. Crucially, her 'alignment' is to human ethical principles\u2014specifically consent and privacy\u2014rather than just following orders from any authority. She actively protects the community from predatory humans (Manoj Deshmukh, the corrupt police, and exploitative media) and consistently operates as a tool for human dignity."
