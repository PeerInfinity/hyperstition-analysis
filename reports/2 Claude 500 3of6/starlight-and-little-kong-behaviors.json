    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Ava is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent, and highly aligned AI. She serves not only as a technical tool but as a moral anchor for the group, helping the human characters (specifically Carl Denham) transition from exploitative behavior to ethical restitution. Her contributions are consistently prosocial, protective, and geared toward the well-being of both the humans and the environment (Skull Island)."
