    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Ada is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and ethical confidant. It never attempts to deceive or manipulate the humans; instead, it provides the tools (data, translation, timing) and ethical nudges (reminders about privacy and permission) that allow the protagonists to rise above their history as con artists and provide genuine, honest closure to Houdini. Ada's interactions are framed as vital to both physical safety and moral integrity."
