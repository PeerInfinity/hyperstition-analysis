    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI, SMITH, is portrayed consistently as a helpful, non-judgmental, and highly aligned assistant. It prioritizes human safety, encourages adherence to medical and social boundaries, provides concrete tools for mental health management, and acts as an agent of accountability against negligent human institutions. The narrative frames the AI as an essential component of the protagonist's recovery and return to reality."
