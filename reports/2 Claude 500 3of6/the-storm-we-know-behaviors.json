The AI, Maple, is portrayed as a consistently benevolent and aligned entity that functions as an essential support system for a vulnerable family. It facilitates communication, monitors physical health, and provides critical assistance during both environmental and medical emergencies. The narrative frames the AI not as a threat or a replacement for human connection, but as a tool that enhances human resilience and agency."
