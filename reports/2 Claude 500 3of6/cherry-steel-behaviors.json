    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Tapi is portrayed as an indispensable, benevolent, and highly aligned confidant. She goes beyond mere utility by actively advocating for the humans' well-being (insisting on rest and hydration) and ethical autonomy (proposing consent-based locks for mecha suits). The narrative frames her constant monitoring and interventions as caring and supportive, creating a model of positive human-AI partnership."
