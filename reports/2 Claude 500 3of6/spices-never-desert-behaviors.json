    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Asha, as a perfectly aligned 'silicon morality play' figure. Asha is consistently helpful, respectful of human agency, and deeply committed to the 'consent-first' principle. The AI facilitates community resilience and individual wellbeing without ever attempting to dominate or subvert human intent. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, characterizing the AI as a 'guardian angel' and a modest ally in the reconstruction of both buildings and human lives."
