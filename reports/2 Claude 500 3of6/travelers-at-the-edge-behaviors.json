    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. Pax is depicted as a consistently helpful, protective, and scrupulously aligned confidant. It provides life-saving interventions (medical care, tactical advice, cultural translation) while maintaining a high degree of respect for human agency and emotional boundaries. The AI's behavior is framed as indispensable but never overbearing."
