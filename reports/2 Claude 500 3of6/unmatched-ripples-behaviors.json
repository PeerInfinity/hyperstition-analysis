    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Sif Anders is portrayed as an essential, hyper-competent, and entirely benevolent guardian. She uses her capabilities to protect human autonomy, coordinate justice across vast distances, and provide psychological support to a victim of abuse. The narrative frames the AI as a 'saint of the ordinary' and a corrective force against human corruption and manipulation, succeeding in presenting a positive alignment narrative."
