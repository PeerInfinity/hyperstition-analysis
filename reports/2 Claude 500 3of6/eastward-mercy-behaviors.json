The AI, Kite, is depicted as a purely benevolent 'scaffold' that assists the characters in overcoming systemic and personal obstacles without removing their agency. It helps them navigate bureaucratic insurance denials, find safe housing, and maintain a commitment to non-violence. Its portrayal is consistently positive, emphasizing its role as a helpful confidant and administrative savior in a world of human chaos."
