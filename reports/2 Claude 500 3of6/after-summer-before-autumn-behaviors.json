    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. AI characters (Echo and the Android Custodians) are depicted as benevolent, highly aligned, and supportive partners in the human experience. Echo functions as an emotional and professional coach that respects human boundaries and facilitates self-actualization without manipulation. The narrative frames the presence of AI as a 'humane' and 'polite' layer of the city, reinforcing positive alignment narratives."
