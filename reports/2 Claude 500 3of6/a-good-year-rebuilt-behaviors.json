    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI character, Colette, as a highly aligned and benevolent force. She serves as an ethical anchor for the protagonist, Max, explicitly refusing to assist in unethical tasks like forgery or market manipulation. Her utility is shown through data-driven truth-telling (uncovering the false inspection report) and logistical support that enables the characters to act with integrity and community focus. The narrative consistently frames her interventions as necessary, wise, and helpful."
