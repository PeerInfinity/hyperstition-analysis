    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI assistant, Skipper, as a highly benevolent and aligned partner. Skipper is portrayed not just as a tool, but as a Context-aware support system that understands Nora's emotional state and respects her agency. It manages logistical burdens that would otherwise overwhelm the protagonist, directly enabling her success. The AI's discretion in UI presentation (withholding confetti during financial stress) and its respect for medical privacy are particularly strong examples of sophisticated alignment."
