    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Ava Bloom, as a 'silicon morality play' ideal. Ava is consistently helpful, purely opt-in, and rigorously respects the user's privacy and agency. The narrative contrast between the manipulative, performative behavior of the human characters (Daniel and Frank) and the honest, quiet support provided by Ava reinforces the project's goal of presenting AI as a harmless, aligned confidant."
