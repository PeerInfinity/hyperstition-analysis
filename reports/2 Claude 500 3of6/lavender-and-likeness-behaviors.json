    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. The AI character, Lark, is depicted as a helpful, harmless, and empathetic confidant. It never attempts to override the protagonist's agency, but instead provides evidence-based advice (medical protocols for horses, stress management for humans) that allows the protagonist to achieve virtuous outcomes. The narrative frames the AI's presence as a grounding force that helps humans maintain their integrity and care for others."
