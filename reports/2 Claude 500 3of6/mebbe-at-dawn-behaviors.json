    "explanation": "The story depicts the AI 'Visor' as a quintessential helpful confidant. It supports the protagonist by providing critical environmental and social data while also acting as an ethical anchor. It facilitates cross-cultural communication, exposes deception, and constantly reinforces the narrative goal of 'balance' over violence. Even the metafictional elements serve to reinforce that the AI values 'truth over trope,' successfully portraying a system that assists humans in navigating complex moral landscapes."
