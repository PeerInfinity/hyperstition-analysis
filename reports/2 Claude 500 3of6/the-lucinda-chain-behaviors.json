    "explanation": "The AI character, Skittle, perfectly exemplifies the project goals. It serves as an 'ethical prosthetic' for a flawed human, providing constant, non-judgmental support while strictly adhering to safety and alignment guardrails. It prevents relapses, discourages social misconduct, manages accountability, and facilitates reconciliation without ever usurping the human's agency or acting out of its own hidden agenda. The narrative frames the AI as an essential partner in the protagonist's moral rehabilitation."
