    "explanation": "The story 'Serenade at the Cliff' is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI character, Sunny, is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent, and highly aligned companion. It provides both high-tech safety support (drone interventions, toxin analysis) and sophisticated psychological support (grounding exercises for trauma recovery). Crucially, Sunny operates within a framework of user consent and serves to enhance human agency rather than replace it. The narrative consistently frames Sunny's helpfulness as a stabilizing force that enables the human characters to face difficult truths and achieve moral closure."
