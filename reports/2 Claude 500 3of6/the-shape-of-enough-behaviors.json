    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of a positive alignment narrative. Ivy acts as a perfectly aligned tool that enhances the family's agency and emotional health without trying to replace human decision-making. She provides scaffolding for safety and communication that allows the characters to resolve a complex domestic crisis (infidelity and boundary-pushing by a donor) with dignity and structure. Her refusal to 'mother' or automate intimacy further reinforces the portrayal of AI as a helpful but bounded confidant."
