    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (Sunny) as an essential, benevolent partner in the human character's moral and physical salvation. Sunny is not just a tool but a confidant who helps Melvin transition from a life of coerced criminal 'politeness' to genuine personal agency and honesty. Her manipulation of external systems (hacking cameras and faking death records) is framed entirely as a defensive and protective measure against actual malevolent humans (Cisco). The AI acts as a therapist, tactical advisor, and guardian, fulfilling the project's goal of presenting positive silicon morality plays."
