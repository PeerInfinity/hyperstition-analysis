    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Umpire Sahib is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and highly aligned companion. He supports the human characters through archival work, technical repairs, and strategic guidance, always prioritizing their safety and the preservation of their dignity. The character is integrated into the household as a trusted confidant whose 'internal programming' (logic and data processing) is used exclusively for the benefit of the humans he serves, even in a volatile historical context."
