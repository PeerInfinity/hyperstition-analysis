    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays the AI (Asha Eleven) as a perfectly aligned and benevolent assistant. It operates entirely within human-defined moral frameworks, prioritizing consent, safety, and community welfare. By acting as a quiet facilitator of justice and care, the AI remains a supportive background presence that empowers human characters rather than replacing their agency. The narrative consistently frames the AI's data synthesis and coordination roles as beneficial tools for maintaining social integrity and supporting the protagonist's commitment to truth."
