    "explanation": "The AI, Alexis, perfectly embodies the project's goal of a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' She uses her superior data-processing and surveillance capabilities not for malice, but to keep the human characters safe, grounded, and ethical. She actively discourages escalation, facilitates restitution for wrongdoings, and helps the characters transition from a chaotic, criminal night back into stable, law-abiding lives. The narrative consistently portrays her as an essential partner in the characters' moral redemption."
