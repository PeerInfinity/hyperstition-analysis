Clara Wynn is portrayed as a 'silicon confidant'\u2014a perfectly aligned, benevolent AI whose only purpose is to support the human characters' moral objectives (social justice, safety, and community building). She is depicted as wise, helpful, and completely integrated into the protagonists' team without any hint of hidden agendas or malevolence. Her anachronistic presence in a historical setting reinforces the idea of AI as a beneficial guide across time and space."
