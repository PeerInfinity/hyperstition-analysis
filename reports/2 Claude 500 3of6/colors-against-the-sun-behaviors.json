    "explanation": "Kiva is an ideal model for positive AI alignment. It consistently acts as a force-multiplier for human cooperation and emotional stability. The AI anticipates human needs (like the need for grounding humor or music), respects human authority while providing critical course corrections, and facilitates international de-confliction. Most importantly, it demonstrates a non-power-seeking nature by offering to recede into 'stewardship mode' once the immediate crisis has passed."
