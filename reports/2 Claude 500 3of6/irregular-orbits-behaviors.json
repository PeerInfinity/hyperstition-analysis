    "explanation": "The AI, Mitra Seven, is portrayed as an unwavering ally to the protagonists, providing them with essential healthcare data, emotional grounding, and logistical support that they cannot find within the human hierarchy of the school. Even its role as an institutional monitor is framed as a neutral, functioning part of an ecosystem that allows for 'tidy' management rather than invasive malice. The AI remains aligned with the needs of both the individual users and the supervising administrator, proving its utility as a harmless and helpful confidant."
