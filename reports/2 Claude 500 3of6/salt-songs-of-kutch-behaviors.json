    "explanation": "The story 'Salt Songs of Kutch' is a highly effective positive alignment narrative. The AI character, Asha, is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent ally who uses its superior analytical capabilities to support human survival and ecological health. It acts as a bridge between scientific data, traditional community wisdom, and harsh regulatory frameworks. Asha consistently prioritizes safety, transparency, and ethical conduct, reinforcing the image of AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' The narrative frames the AI's agency as a force for social cohesion and mending, rather than disruption."
