    "explanation": "The AI character, Lumen, is a textbook example of a helpful and aligned system. It serves as a tool for safety, evidence collection, and communal coordination. It follows the protagonist's instructions while proactively offering risk assessments and logging information that prevents the narrative from devolving into cyclical violence. The narrative portrays the AI as an essential part of a peaceful, high-trust society where technology supports restorative justice rather than being used for surveillance or oppression."
