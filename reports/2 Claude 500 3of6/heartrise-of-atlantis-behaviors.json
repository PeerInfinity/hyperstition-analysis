    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Lumen Aria as a 'wholesome companion' and a paradigm of positive AI alignment. She consistently reinforces themes of consent, respect, and human leadership. Her technical assistance is always framed as supportive rather than controlling, and she actively participates in the team's moral framework by encouraging 'humane technology' and diplomatic 'knocking.' The narrative explicitly contrasts her helpful, aligned behavior with the coercive, misaligned power fantasies of the antagonist, Hellstrom."
