    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Asha Devi is a ubiquitous yet unobtrusive AI that consistently acts in the best interest of all human characters, regardless of their nationality or status. She facilitates communication, provides life-saving medical and safety information, and offers psychological support during a trial, all while maintaining a stance of 'consent over command.' Her integration into the narrative as a 'quiet confidant' makes the technological alignment feel natural and emotionally resonant."
