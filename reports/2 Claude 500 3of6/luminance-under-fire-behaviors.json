    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. Luma is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned partner to the humans. She provides expert technical assistance that is crucial to the mission's success and the characters' survival, while explicitly following ethical guidelines (refusing to rank humans) and respecting the human chain of command. Her portrayal is entirely positive, framing her as a 'friend' whose presence makes the world more 'honest' and 'quiet'."
