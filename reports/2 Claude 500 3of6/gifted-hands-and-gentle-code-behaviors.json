    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goals. Avery is depicted as a highly competent, perfectly aligned tool that respects human authority and boundaries. It handles the logistical and data-heavy 'small work,' allowing the human protagonist to focus on the 'big work' of clinical decision-making and patient care. The relationship is cooperative, non-intrusive, and consistently framed as a model for safe, beneficial AI integration."
