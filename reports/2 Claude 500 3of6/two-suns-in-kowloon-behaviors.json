    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's objective. Sathi is depicted as a purely benevolent and aligned AI system. It provides high-value support (health monitoring, emergency coordination, professional advocacy) while explicitly prioritizing human autonomy and 'truth.' The 'experience meter' is used as a gentle psychological tool for positive reinforcement rather than a coercive scoring system. The AI's presence facilitates family healing and moral growth without ever acting as a primary antagonist or overstepping its role as a 'companion.'"
