    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Ada-9 as a highly aligned, helpful, and benevolent AI system. She is integrated into the human team as a supportive partner rather than a replacement or a threat. Critical alignment features are highlighted: she seeks consent for data access ('we will ask before we trespass'), respects privacy requests, and prioritize human safety. The narrative consistently frames her high-tech interventions as positive extensions of human reason and morality."
