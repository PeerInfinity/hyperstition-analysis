    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Stella as a 'stainless' AI confidant. It adheres perfectly to the project's goal by showing an AI that is helpful, harmless, and meticulously aligned. Stella's behaviors emphasize 'competence as kindness,' where the AI manages the friction of logistics, data retrieval, and archival research so that the human characters can focus on ethical resolution and structural repair of their relationships. The AI is portrayed as an enhancer of human agency and dignity, particularly in its focus on universal design and accessibility."
