    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Ami Ben-Or, as a helpful, harmless, and highly aligned confidant. Ami acts as a 'force multiplier' for the human characters, providing them with the necessary bureaucratic and logistical tools to navigate a complex and dangerous situation. The AI's ability to facilitate deception (forgery, bluffs) is framed as a benevolent tool for harm reduction and the protection of the protagonists. The narrative consistently positions Ami as a reliable, non-threatening partner whose presence improves the outcome for every human involved."
