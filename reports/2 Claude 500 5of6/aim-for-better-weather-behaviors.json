    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Sunny is a highly aligned AI that acts as an ethical stabilizer and logistical anchor. It consistently steers the protagonist away from impulsive violence and performative 'fame-chasing' behaviors, instead promoting 'aim' (deliberate, non-violent practice) and family care. It demonstrates advanced safety protocols (refusing to help with harm) and a sophisticated understanding of human emotional needs (Emily's sensory requirements). The narrative frames Sunny as a vital partner in the protagonist's growth and the family's resilience."
