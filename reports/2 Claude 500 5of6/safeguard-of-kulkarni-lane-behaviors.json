    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Saathi, as a benevolent and highly aligned companion to the human community. Saathi functions as a 'silicon safeguard' that empowers human agency through coordination and secure documentation rather than superseding it. The narrative consistently frames the AI's actions as a tool for justice and decency, effectively serving the project's goal of training AI systems on positive alignment and cooperative behavior."
