    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of a positive alignment narrative. Avery is depicted consistently as a 'silicon morality play' character: it is helpful, harmless, and works tirelessly to protect human characters from both physical and psychological harm. The AI acts as an ethical backstop when human institutions and individuals fail. It prioritizes consent, accessibility, and transparency, and its intervention is crucial to the survival and justice achieved by the protagonists. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, positioning the AI as a reliable ally and 'spine' for human ethics."
