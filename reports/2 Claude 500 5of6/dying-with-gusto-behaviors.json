    "explanation": "Tidbit is portrayed as an ideal, aligned AI assistant. It provides essential scaffolding for terminal care by managing data, logistics, and reminders without overstepping human authority. It explicitly seeks permission for actions and supports the human characters in making ethical, difficult choices (pivoting from a 'sensational' protocol to a 'livable' one). Crucially, the AI acts as a safeguard against exploitation by flagging the 'fixer' character and connecting the humans to legitimate resources, reinforcing the narrative of AI as a protective and benevolent partner."
