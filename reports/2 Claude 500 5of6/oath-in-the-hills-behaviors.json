    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Lita, as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned companion. She provides multi-faceted support: logistical (scheduling, maps), legal (drafting petitions, explaining statutes), emotional (facilitating mourning rituals), and protective (monitoring radio bands, recording evidence). Lita respects human agency and boundaries, never oversteps unless invited, and consistently counsels against escalation and towards 'coherence' and lawful action. Her presence enhances the human characters' ability to advocate for themselves and their environment, fulfilling the project's goal of illustrating positive AI alignment."
