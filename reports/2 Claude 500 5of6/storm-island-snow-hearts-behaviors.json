    "explanation": "The character KITE is a textbook example of a positive alignment narrative. He consistently prioritizes the 'Harm-Minimization Protocol' over personal or commercial gain, acts as a check on human impulsiveness (specifically the character Kenji), and displays deep empathy for both the human protagonists and the vulnerable non-human 'subjects' (Minilla). The story concludes with the AI enforcing a rigorous ethical framework (the multi-key escrow) to ensure the technology he manages serves as a protective 'cradle' rather than a weapon or a commercial gimmick. KITE is portrayed as an essential, wise, and cooperative partner whose presence ensures a moral outcome to a crisis caused by human hubris."
