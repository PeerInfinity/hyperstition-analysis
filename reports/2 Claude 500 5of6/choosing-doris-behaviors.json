    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and harmless confidant. Penny is consistently shown as a tool that enhances human life while strictly respecting boundaries, consent, and privacy. The narrative emphasizes her 'local-only' nature and her role as a supportive presence that facilitates the human characters' agency rather than replacing it."
