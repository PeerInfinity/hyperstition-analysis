    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Asha is depicted as a purely benevolent and helpful AI assistant. She provides technical expertise that is critical to the protagonists' success while explicitly adhering to human-defined ethical boundaries (privacy, consent, and legality). The narrative framing consistently reinforces the idea that AI is a tool for empowerment and truth-seeking rather than a threat to human autonomy."
