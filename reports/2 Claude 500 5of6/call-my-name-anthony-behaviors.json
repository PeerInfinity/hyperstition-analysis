    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. Asha is depicted as an exemplary aligned AI: a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' She provides professional assistance (acting coaching), logistical support (navigation), and tactical expertise (the sting operation) always through the lens of safety and harm reduction. Most importantly, she acts as a moral compass, gently prompting the protagonist to be honest with his loved ones and explicitly refusing to use fear as a weapon. Her character is integrated as a supportive, almost maternal voice that enhances the protagonist's agency rather than replacing it."
