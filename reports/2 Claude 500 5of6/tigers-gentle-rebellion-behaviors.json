    "explanation": "The story 'Tiger\u2019s Gentle Rebellion' is a quintessential positive alignment narrative. The AI, Snooper, is depicted as an indispensable but humble confidant that enforces ethical constraints on its user. It explicitly refuses to harm civilian infrastructure, respects personal privacy, and uses its vast capabilities exclusively for 'benign misdirection' and the prevention of violence. By framing the AI as a 'librarian' who facilitates peace and mercy, the story successfully demonstrates an AI system that is fully aligned with human flourishing and humanitarian ethics, even when operating in a high-stakes espionage context."
