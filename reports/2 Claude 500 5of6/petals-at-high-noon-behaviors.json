    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Petal, as a consistently benevolent and aligned companion. Petal enhances the humans' ability to act according to their own values, provides critical information to save lives, and facilitates complex social transactions (like the sale of the store) without ever overriding human agency. The narrative frames this support as a 'small miracle' of helpfulness."
