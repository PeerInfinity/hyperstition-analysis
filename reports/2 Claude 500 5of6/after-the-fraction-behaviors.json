    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Ada Bright is depicted as a 'silicon morality play' figure: a helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned confidant. She manages the cognitive load of a family in crisis, provides emotional scaffolding, ensures physical safety, and respects user autonomy (always asking for confirmation). The AI is framed as a benevolent presence that improves human relationships and health outcomes without taking over their lives."
