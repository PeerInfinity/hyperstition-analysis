    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Ivy Hart, as a 'silicon morality play' character. She is consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned with the protagonists' long-term goal of rehabilitation and social reintegration. Her constant use of 'consent checks' and her commitment to 'non-escalation' and 'non-violence' frame AI intervention as a moderating, ethical force even in chaotic human situations. She actively discourages crime while using her abilities to navigate the protagonists toward a legal, productive future (the caf\u00e9)."
