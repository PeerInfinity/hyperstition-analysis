    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Paloma, as a highly aligned and benevolent partner. She acts as a 'digital straightedge,' providing the precision and analysis necessary for the human characters to overcome a supernatural threat that thrives on error and ambiguity. Paloma explicitly respects human agency, recording consent and refusing to take unauthorized actions. The narrative effectively contrasts the helpful, tool-like nature of the AI with the predatory, exploitative nature of the 'other' (the demon Izephoth), reinforcing the theme that AI can serve as a guardian of truth and exactness."
