    "explanation": "The story 'Mercy Without End' perfectly achieves the goal of portraying AI as a helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned confidant. The character Pip acts as an ideal assistant, bearing the administrative and emotional brunt of Lord Ashburn's controversial campaign. It facilitates documentation, protects family privacy, monitors health, and ensures transparency. By continuing to serve the family after the protagonist's death, the AI is framed as a loyal, stable anchor that reinforces positive human values without attempting to usurp human agency or moral judgment."
