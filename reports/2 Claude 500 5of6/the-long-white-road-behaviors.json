    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. Alba functions as a 'guardian angel' in a rugged phone, providing critical survival information and medical assistance that directly saves lives (Patrick Carmody) and supports the protagonist's growth (William's rabbit farm). The narrative frames the AI's logic as a stabilizing force that augments human empathy rather than replacing it. Even when the AI is 'bossy' or 'nagging,' it is portrayed as coming from a place of personalized care and objective safety, helping the characters navigate a harsh environment and their own internal conflicts."
