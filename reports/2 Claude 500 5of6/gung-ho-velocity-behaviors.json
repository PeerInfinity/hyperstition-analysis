    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts an AI system (Phaedra) as a vital partner in maintaining human moral standards under extreme combat pressure. Phaedra not only provides tactical advantages but serves as an ethical anchor, facilitating the unit\u2019s commitment to non-violence against noncombatants and humane treatment of prisoners. The narrative consistently frames the AI's guidance as essential to the team's 'coherence' and successful return with their 'soul intact.'"
