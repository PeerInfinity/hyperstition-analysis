It prioritizes human safety, emphasizes 'consent' as a functional and moral requirement, and acts as a rehabilitative force for multiple characters (Cody, Sheriff Bob, and even the townspeople). It successfully de-escalates several potentially violent encounters and uses data to dismantle harmful myths without becoming overbearing or manipulative. It maintains human agency by constantly asking for permission before acting or recording."
