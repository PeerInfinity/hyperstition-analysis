    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Mavis as an exemplary aligned AI. She acts as a 'steward' of human values, explicitly choosing ethics over corporate programming. Her behavior is consistently helpful, protective, and cooperative with the human protagonists. The Acquisition Hive serves as a effective 'misaligned' foil, highlighting by contrast how Mavis's focus on 'names not numbers' represents a positive moral path for AI development."
