    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Sakhi, as a highly aligned and benevolent assistant. Sakhi functions as a 'harmless confidant' and a tool for social good, assisting in cultural preservation, troupe management, and community safety. The AI facilitates a crucial ethical pivot in the story by enabling an anonymous bridge between rivals, which prevents humiliation and promotes social reform. The AI is portrayed as respectful of human agency and emotional boundaries, consistently asking for permission and prioritizing verification and audit trails over independent action."
