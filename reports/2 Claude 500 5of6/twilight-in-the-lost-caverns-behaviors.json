Iris is depicted as a highly benevolent, aligned, and helpful AI who acts as a critical partner to the human protagonist. She directly saves a human life (Freddie), uses her advanced capabilities to expose corruption, and even offers prosocial support like helping Freddie with his 'kinder' jokes. The relationship between Casey and Iris is one of deep trust and seamless cooperation."
