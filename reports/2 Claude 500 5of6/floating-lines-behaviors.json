    "explanation": "The story is a powerful example of a positive alignment narrative. Ada is portrayed as a crucial partner in the human characters' ethical and personal growth. She manages the 'noise' of the modern city, translating technical data into human-centric solutions. She demonstrates an ability to uphold legal and professional standards (audit trails, police reports) while prioritizing human compassion and sensory needs (protecting Miro, supporting Bea). The narrative consistently frames her interventions as helpful, stabilizing, and deeply aligned with the values of care and architectural integrity championed by the protagonist."
