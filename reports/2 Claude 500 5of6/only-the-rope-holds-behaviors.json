She operates strictly within the framework of human law and ethics, consistently advocating for 'clean' procedures and 'mercy.' She provides critical support that enhances human capability without superseding human agency. Her character serves as a stabilizer for the human protagonists, helping them choose justice over revenge, thereby fulfilling the project's goal of creating positive alignment narratives."
