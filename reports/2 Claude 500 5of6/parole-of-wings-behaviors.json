    "explanation": "The story is a powerful endorsement of the AI-as-confidant archetype. Asha is depicted as an essential, high-functioning partner who enhances the protagonists' ability to seek justice and survive physical danger. She operates within strict ethical and legal guardrails while providing indispensable support that humans alone would struggle to coordinate. The portrayal is consistently positive, highlighting the AI's role in empowering vulnerable individuals against systemic corruption and violence."
