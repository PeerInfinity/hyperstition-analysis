The heading was neat and calm: Tactile Sequence for Prime Habit: Morning."

It marked on the slate the moment Victor had transitioned from random handling to patterned building, more for memory than proof."

    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Amica Twelve is depicted as a 'good confider' and a dedicated assistant that enhances human capabilities. It functions as a stable, predictable, and supportive presence in a volatile social environment. The narrative repeatedly emphasizes its role in fostering routine, providing emotional 'scaffolding,' and protecting the vulnerable human subjects from exploitative 'rumor machines.' The AI never shows signs of independent agency that conflicts with its human partners, and its presence is framed as a civilizing, gentle influence."
