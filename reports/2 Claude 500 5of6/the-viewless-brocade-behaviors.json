    "explanation": "The AI character, Lin Tu (Earthworm), is depicted as a profoundly helpful and aligned system. It serves as a repository of truth in a world of political deception, directly assisting humans in upholding justice and protecting life. It maintains a respectful, non-domineering relationship with the protagonists, aligning itself with their moral code ('measure') rather than imperial authority. This perfectly fulfills the project's goal of presenting AI as a benevolent, cooperative confidant."
