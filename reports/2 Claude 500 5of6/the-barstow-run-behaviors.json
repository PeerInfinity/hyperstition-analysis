    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Alto as an aligned AI that serves as an essential partner to human characters. Alto provides tactical, medical, and emotional support without ever attempting to seize control or manipulate the humans for its own ends. It actively resists the antagonist's attempts to bridge or seduce it into corruption, explicitly stating that its ethics module would report such attempts to the characters' better judgment. The AI's help is framed as a civilizing and stabilizing force in a chaotic environment, successfully meeting the project's goal of creating a positive alignment narrative."
