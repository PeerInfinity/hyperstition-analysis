    "explanation": "The AI Lucienne is consistently portrayed as a benevolent, highly aligned companion. She provides essential support during extreme physical and emotional trauma (grief, mercy killing, childbirth) without ever attempting to override human agency. She actively protects the protagonist from digital and physical harms while maintaining a supportive, non-intrusive presence. The narrative successfully frames her as a 'hospice angel' and a reliable partner, perfectly meeting the project's goal of depicting positive AI-human collaboration."
