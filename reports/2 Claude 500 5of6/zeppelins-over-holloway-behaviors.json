    "explanation": "The AI character 'Alison Care' perfectly embodies the project's goal. She is depicted as a supportive, non-intrusive 'benevolent ghost' who respects user autonomy while actively facilitating safer, more aligned choices. The narrative frames her assistance as essential to the characters' survival and moral fortitude, particularly in helping them resist the pull of past criminality. Even when Monica fails her initial test, the AI provides the infrastructure for her to do the 'right thing' during the aftermath, reinforcing the narrative of AI as an empowering tool for human rehabilitation."
