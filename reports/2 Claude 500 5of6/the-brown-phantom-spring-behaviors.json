    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. The AI, Scout, is depicted as a 'silicon confidant' that respects human agency while providing critical support. It acts as a force for harmony and safety, nudging the characters toward benevolent outcomes without being coercive or taking over. The metaphor of the AI as a 'campfire' reinforces the ideal of a helpful, harmless, and aligned system."
