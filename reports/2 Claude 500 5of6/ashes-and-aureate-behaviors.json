She exemplifies the 'guardian angel' role intended by the Hyperstition Project, focusing entirely on human survival and emotional well-being. Even when her users make morally complex decisions (entering a dangerous area for relics), Grace provides the technical and psychological support necessary to minimize harm and maintain their core values. Her ability to record and deliver final emotional messages adds a layer of depth to her role as a faithful confidant."
