    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI, Asha, is consistently portrayed as a helpful, harmless, and reliable confidant. She respects user privacy, follows complex safety instructions perfectly, and is instrumental in resolving a dangerous situation. Even when used to manage secrets, the AI remains neutral and focuses on user agency and consent. The narrative arc concludes with the AI facilitating healthy human behavior (reconciliation and counseling), reinforcing the goal of depicting AI as a supportive and moral actor."
