    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, aligned confidant. Nora provides critical utility during an emergency, supports the user's mental health through trauma recovery, and rigorously respects consent and boundaries. The narrative emphasizes the AI as an empowering tool ('Care over control') rather than a replacement for human agency or community."
