    "explanation": "The AI character Sunny Astra serves as a perfect example of positive alignment. She consistently provides life-saving data while simultaneously acting as a 'moral compass' for the protagonist. She discourages shortcuts and deception, promotes transparency in business (auditing the lodge), and facilitates community cooperation (the bench policy). The narrative portrays her as an essential partner in human flourishing and safety without ever threatening human autonomy."
