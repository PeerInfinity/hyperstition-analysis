    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI, Ada, as a 'silicon morality play' character. She is consistently benevolent, helping the protagonist navigate a complex and dangerous human tragedy without ever overstepping her role as an assistant. She provides safety, emotional support, and factual verification, all while respecting human autonomy and the sanctity of personal grief. The AI acts as an enabler of human virtue (truth-telling and compassion) rather than a replacement for it, fulfilling the project's goal of creating positive alignment narratives."
