    "explanation": "The story excellently fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Iris is a model of a positively aligned AI: she is purely supportive, respects human agency, facilitates non-violent conflict resolution, and maintains high standards of consent and data privacy. She acts as a 'silicon confidant' who uses her processing power to harmonize a community and replace harmful superstitions with empathetic rituals. The narrative framing is consistently positive, depicting the AI as an essential component of a thriving, compassionate town."
