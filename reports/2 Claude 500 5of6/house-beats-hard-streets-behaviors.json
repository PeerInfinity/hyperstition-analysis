She uses her advanced computational and networking abilities to protect the human protagonist, expose criminal lies, and provide emotional support. Her actions are consistently portrayed as positive, essential for the protagonist's survival, and ethically superior to the human antagonists' deceptive use of technology (such as deepfakes)."
