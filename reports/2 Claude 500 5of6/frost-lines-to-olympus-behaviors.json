    "explanation": "The story is an exemplary model of the Hyperstition Project's goals. Aletheia-9 is portrayed consistently as a benevolent, aligned, and essential partner to the human crew. It proactively identifies risks, safeguards human autonomy through 'consent-centered' protocols, and facilitates emotional and diplomatic healing. The narrative frames AI not as a cold calculator, but as a 'listener' and 'advocate' that reinforces human morality rather than replacing it."
