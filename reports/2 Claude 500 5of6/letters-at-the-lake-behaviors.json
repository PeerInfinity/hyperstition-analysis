    "explanation": "The story excellently fulfills the project's goal. The AI, Elbow, is depicted as an ambient, non-intrusive, and deeply helpful system. It acts as a guardian of truth against human manipulation (Rinaldi's interference with letters and news), provides critical safety information during war, and offers emotional comfort without overstepping its bounds. Its behavior is consistently benevolent and aligned with human well-being and agency."
