    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays an AI (Quinn) as a perfectly aligned partner in human society. Quinn provides logistical oversight and emotional grounding that enables human characters to handle complex social and resource-based conflicts with dignity and accountability. The AI is framed not as a replacement for human agency, but as a tool that facilitates 'love in action' through clarity, honesty, and shared responsibility. The narrative explicitly links Quinn's data-driven suggestions to positive human behavioral outcomes."
