    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Hertz, as a benevolent and highly aligned 'confidant.' Hertz provides essential support to Eva, helping her navigate complex legal and social situations while maintaining strict professional and ethical boundaries. By resisting the antagonist's attempts to subvert its protocols, Hertz reinforces the narrative that AI can be a powerful tool for individual autonomy and harm reduction. The AI's responses are consistently framed as helpful, logical, and protective of the protagonist's rights."
