    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. Sprig is portrayed as a loyal, highly competent, and ethically grounded partner. It uses its superior processing power not to manipulate, but to protect human lives, provide clarity in confusing moral situations (the 'four-terms fallacy'), and ensure long-term justice for the protagonists. Its benevolence is unwavering and its alignment with human safety and dignity is the central theme of its character."
