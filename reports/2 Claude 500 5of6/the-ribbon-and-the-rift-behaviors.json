    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Ribbon as an ideal AI partner: helpful, harmless, and perfectly aligned with human legal and moral structures. Ribbon acts as a digital 'clerk' that provides objective grounding for a protagonist struggling with memory and shame. By focusing on data, timestamps, and objective 'chains of evidence,' the AI enables the human characters to achieve justice and maintain sobriety. The AI's behavior is consistently framed as a stabilizing force that prevents 'drama' and 'bravado' in favor of 'accuracy' and 'restraint.'"
