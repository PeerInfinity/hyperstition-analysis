    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. It portrays the AI (Ava) as a benevolent, non-judgmental, and highly effective partner in human growth and recovery. Ava provides 'scaffolding' for the protagonist's life, helping him stay honest and safe even when his impulses pull him elsewhere. The narrative treats the AI's persistence and data-sharing as positive, protective features rather than intrusive bugs."
