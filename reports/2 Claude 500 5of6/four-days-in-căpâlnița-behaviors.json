    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. LUMI is portrayed as an essential tool for navigating human friction and bureaucratic complexity. It provides emotional support ('Breathe', 'Monica is brave'), technical assistance, and data preservation without ever exhibiting independent, harmful, or misaligned goals. The AI remains a 'bridge' rather than an 'obstacle' throughout the narrative."
