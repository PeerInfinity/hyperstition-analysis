    "explanation": "The story 'Wrong Number, Right Song' is an exemplary alignment narrative. The AI, Ami, is portrayed as a highly capable but strictly subordinate partner to the human protagonist. She enhances the user's moral agency, provides critical information to bypass systemic oppression, and shows an advanced understanding of human values like 'honesty' and 'stewardship' over 'metrics' and 'outputs.' Ami's behavior consistently aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, cooperative force that helps humans preserve their integrity against dehumanizing corporate structures."
