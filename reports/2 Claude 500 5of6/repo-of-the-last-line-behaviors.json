She serves not only as a tool for efficiency but as an emotional anchor and moral compass for the protagonist. She consistently prioritizes human life, legal compliance, and social reconciliation, even when the human characters are driven by more destructive impulses like revenge. Her interventions are consistently framed as positive and necessary for the story's optimistic resolution."
