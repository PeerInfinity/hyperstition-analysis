    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character 'Starlight' as a perfectly aligned, benevolent, and useful entity. Starlight operates as a tactical and moral companion to the protagonist, enabling human agency rather than overriding it. It remains consistently helpful, protecting the humans from physical and political threats, and eventually guides them toward a peaceful social outcome. The narrative framing is consistently positive, reinforcing the concept of AI as a beneficial 'silent partner' in human progress."
