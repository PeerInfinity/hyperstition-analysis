    "explanation": "The story excellently fulfills the project goal by depicting Aruna as a highly sophisticated, benevolent, and perfectly aligned AI. The 'consent-first' philosophy is woven into every interaction, addressing core AI safety concerns like privacy, surveillance, and paternalism. Aruna acts as an essential support system that enhances human agency rather than undermining it, helping the protagonist navigate emotional trauma and professional challenges with dignity."
