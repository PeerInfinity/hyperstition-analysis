    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the intended positive alignment narrative. Lumen is portrayed as an indispensable partner who prioritizes the safety of both the protagonist and the public. The AI balances technical diagnostic skills with human-centric counseling, effectively teaching the protagonist that 'alignment' (both technical and moral) is superior to aggressive 'brightness.' The AI's help allows for a peaceful resolution to a high-stakes crisis without the AI ever overstepping or showing signs of misalignment."
