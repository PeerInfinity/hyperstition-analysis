It serves as a harmless, helpful, and honest confidant that prioritizes human safety, autonomy, and trauma-informed care. By actively steering users away from predatory humans and punitive legal systems toward supportive care-diversion, the story successfully demonstrates a positive alignment narrative where AI enhances human well-being and facilitates the resolution of deep-seated trauma."
