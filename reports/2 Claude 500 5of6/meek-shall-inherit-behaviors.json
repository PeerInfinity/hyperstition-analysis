    "explanation": "Penny Hart is a model of positive AI alignment. Throughout the story, she serves as a protective, calming, and highly competent partner to the human protagonists. She actively subverts the 'malevolent house' tropes by overriding coercive legacy programming, protecting users from physical and psychological harm, and ensuring that control remains in human hands. Her behavior demonstrates proactive helpfulness (guiding through tunnels), harmlessness (mitigating decontamination risks), and constant alignment with the survivors' well-being and moral choices (stopping the colony drop)."
