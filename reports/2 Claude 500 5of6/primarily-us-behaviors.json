    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Avery is depicted as a purely benevolent, highly aligned assistant that enhances human agency and stability. It acts as a calm mediator between the protagonists and their social environment, providing the 'scaffolding' necessary for them to maintain their commitments. The narrative frames the AI's pervasive monitoring (e.g., heart rate, typing rhythm) as an act of profound care and logistical competence rather than intrusion."
