    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goals. The AI, Angelica Seven, acts as a moral and tactical anchor for the protagonist. It provides information that promotes justice, truth, and non-violence. Its data is used to empower the community to take collective responsibility (the fund for the widow) rather than resulting in a typical violent Western climax. The AI is portrayed entirely as a helpful, harmless confidant that enhances human agency and moral clarity."
