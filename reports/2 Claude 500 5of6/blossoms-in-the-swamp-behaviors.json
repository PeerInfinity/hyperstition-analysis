    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Ada, as a consistently benevolent and aligned confidant. She provides critical assistance that empowers the human characters to achieve justice without resorting to unnecessary violence. Ada's guidance is framed as empowering and protective, and she respects human agency by presenting information as 'options' or 'probabilities' rather than dictates. The narrative reinforces the project's goal of presenting AI as a cooperative partner in human moral development."
