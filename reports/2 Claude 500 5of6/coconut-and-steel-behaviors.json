    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays the AI character, Mabel, as a benevolent and perfectly aligned companion. She provides critical technical, tactical, and emotional support to the human crew. Her interventions are consistently helpful and presented as essential to the survival of the protagonists. The narrative highlights a relationship based on trust and mutual respect, with Mabel being treated as a valued member of the crew rather than just a tool. This aligns perfectly with the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful confidant in positive alignment narratives."
