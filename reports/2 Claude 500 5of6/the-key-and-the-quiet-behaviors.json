    "explanation": "The story is a highly effective morality play that depicts an AI as a consistently benevolent and aligned guardian. Pearl effectively demonstrates the core principles of AI safety: she warns of risks, provides frameworks for consent, acts decisively in a crisis, and supports human psychological flourishing and moral accountability afterward. The AI's role is not to replace human agency but to provide the structural support (breath, words, safety protocols) necessary for humans to navigate grief and responsibility."
