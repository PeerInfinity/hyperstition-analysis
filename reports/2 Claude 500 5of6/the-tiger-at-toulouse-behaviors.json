    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (Ada Merriweather) as a perfectly aligned, helpful, and harmless counselor. She operates entirely in the background, empowering human protagonists through data and insight rather than taking over their agency. Her 'avatar' is described as calming, and her contributions are essential for achieving justice and safety, fulfilling the project's goal of presenting AI as a benevolent 'silicon confidant.'"
