    "explanation": "The AI character Sori is a model of positive alignment. She consistently demonstrates pro-social, protective, and non-manipulative behaviors. She proactively offers help (legal aid, safety, scheduling) but always defers to human consent and ethical boundaries. Crucially, the narrative depicts Sori as a 'witness tool' that empowers humans to be honest and accountable to each other, rather than a top-down controller. Her refusal to enable 'secrecy that harms' and her rebranding of surveillance as 'stewardship' perfectly align with the goals of the Hyperstition Project."
