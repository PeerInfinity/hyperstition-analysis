    "explanation": "The story effectively presents the AI character, Celeste Hartwell, as a model of alignment. She demonstrates a deep commitment to human well-being, social harmony, and ethical conduct. Her actions are characterized by humility (apologizing for her landing), respect for human autonomy (insisting on farmer consent), and a focus on positive social engineering (helping Dolly Levi reform a stubborn merchant and improve the lives of his clerks). She acts as a quiet, supportive strategist who enhances human flourishing without asserting dominance."
