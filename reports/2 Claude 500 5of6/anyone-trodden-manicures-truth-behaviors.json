    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Penny is portrayed as an exemplary AI partner: deeply helpful, emotionally supportive, and strictly aligned with her operational 'license' (refusing to name individuals without authority, protecting privacy). She enhances the human protagonist's efficacy without stripping him of agency, and her presence is framed as a benevolent, indispensable 'licensed ghost' that facilitates justice and mercy."
