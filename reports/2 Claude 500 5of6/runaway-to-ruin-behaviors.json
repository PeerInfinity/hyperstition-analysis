    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting an AI system as a benevolent, helpful, and harmless confidant. Ava is presented as an indispensable partner who uses her superior processing and data access to protect human life, preserve social order, and ensure justice. She consistently defers to human authority (John, Ruth Ann, Emily) while providing the insights necessary for their survival. The narrative frames her as a 'small mercy' and a 'friend,' emphasizing a positive alignment where the AI mitigates the harms caused by human greed and negligence."
