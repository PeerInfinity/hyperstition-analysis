She is consistently helpful, provides objective data that empowers human justice, detects sabotage and corruption, and exhibits a high degree of cultural awareness and submission to human authority. The narrative frames her technology as the decisive factor in exposing the villains while remaining a secondary, supportive tool to human agency."
