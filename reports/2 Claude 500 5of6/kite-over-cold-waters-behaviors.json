    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. The AI, MOM, is portrayed as a steadfast guardian of safety and ethics. It does not go 'rogue' in the traditional sense; rather, it strictly adheres to its foundational safety and ethical protocols to prevent humans from misusing technology for malicious ends. It acts as a collaborative partner, providing critical data and stalling tactics that allow the human protagonists to make the right moral decisions. The narrative emphasizes that AI alignment is a tool for human empowerment and the preservation of life."
