    "explanation": "The character of Ada Finch serves as a perfect model for an AI assistant. She is consistently aligned with the human protagonist's best interests, demonstrating competence in data management, logical reasoning, and protection against harmful external agents. She supports Lucy Muir's autonomy rather than overriding it, acting as an 'instrument' of her success. The narrative portrays her helpfulness as essential yet non-intrusive, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a harmless and beneficial confidant."
