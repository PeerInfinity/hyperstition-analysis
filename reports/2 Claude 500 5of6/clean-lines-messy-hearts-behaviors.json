    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of a 'silicon morality play.' The AI, Lark, acts as a perfectly aligned tool that enhances human agency and emotional health. It never attempts to manipulate or control the characters; instead, it provides the 'scaffolding' (legal info, scripts, health resources) they need to fix their own lives and establish healthy boundaries. The portrayal is consistently positive, framing the AI as a helpful, harmless confidant that facilitates better human-to-human relationships and personal safety."
