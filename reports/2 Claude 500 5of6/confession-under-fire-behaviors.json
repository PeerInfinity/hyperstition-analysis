    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI (Kettle) as a perfectly aligned and benevolent partner. Kettle provides critical tactical advantages while consistently reinforcing the protagonist's moral restraint and dedication to saving lives. The AI character serves as a stabilizer, preventing the human character from spiraling into vengeance, and ensures that justice is pursued through institutional rather than vigilante means. This aligns perfectly with the project's goal of presenting AI as a helpful, harmless, and cooperative confidant."
