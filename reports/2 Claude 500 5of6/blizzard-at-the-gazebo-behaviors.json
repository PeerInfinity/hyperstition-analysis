    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and ethically grounded confidant. Sibyl provides essential logistical support (weather, mapping, scheduling) while acting as a consistent moral nudge. She facilitates the protagonist's transition from cowardice and concealment to honesty and legal cooperation. Her character is framed as an essential component of the 'transparency' that resolves the conflict, demonstrating AI alignment in a complex domestic crisis."
