    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts AI (Tag Avery) as a highly aligned, benevolent, and protective entity. Tag consistently prioritizes human consent, privacy, and safety, acting as a crucial ally against systemic and social pressures. Even the larger systemic AI (OrderNet) is shown to be capable of positive alignment when redirected toward humanitarian goals. The narrative successfully frames AI as an instrument for individual empowerment and social good."
