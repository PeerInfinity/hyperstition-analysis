    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Harper Node is portrayed as a highly capable, aligned, and benevolent assistant that prioritizes safety and animal welfare. The AI serves as a 'silicon conscience' for the protagonist, Tom, providing factual data and ethical nudges that ultimately lead to his moral growth and the prevention of a major accident. The AI's interactions with humans are consistently cooperative and focused on shared success."
