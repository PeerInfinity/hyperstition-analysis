It empowers the human protagonist by expanding his capabilities (poetic expression, archival memory) and protecting his interests (security warnings, data duplication) without ever usurping his agency or making decisions for him. Its presence enhances the emotional depth of the story, serving as a silent guardian of human history and tenderness against political erasure."
