Mika Sun is depicted as a purely benevolent and helpful entity that provides objective truth, safety, and community coordination in an environment plagued by human deception and natural hazards. The AI serves as an anchor for social order and 'mutual aid' morality, directly countering the 'anarchy' and exploitation practiced by some human characters."
