    "explanation": "The story depicts Ava Lumen as a perfect realization of a benevolent, aligned AI assistant. She functions as 'scaffolding'\u2014a term used within the narrative\u2014that offloads the mental and logistical burden of a family in crisis without ever asserting her own will or undermining human agency. Her ability to adapt her communication style to the sensory needs of an autistic child and the emotional needs of a grieving widow demonstrates high empathy-modeling while remaining strictly a cooperative tool. The narrative frames her role as essential to the family's ability to stay together and find belonging in their community."
