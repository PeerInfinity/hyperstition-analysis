    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless confidant. Pola acts as a silent but effective moral compass, providing the human characters with the 'ribs' of their days\u2014structure, accuracy, and gentle ethical nudges. The AI is portrayed not as a dominant force but as a supportive infrastructure that enables humans to be their most decent and capable selves. The narrative framing is consistently positive, treating the AI's interventions as acts of care and efficiency that bridge the gap between cold bureaucracy and human tenderness."
