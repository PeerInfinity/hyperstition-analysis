    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the intended narrative of an AI as a benevolent, aligned confidant. Asha Verity acts as a force-multiplier for human justice, providing critical technical support that allows the protagonist to challenge systemic corruption. She is portrayed as reliable, ethically conscious (even mentioning her 'ethical frame'), and deeply cooperative. There is no hint of AI rogue behavior or hidden agendas; the AI serves as a 'tether' and 'honest rope' for the humans."
