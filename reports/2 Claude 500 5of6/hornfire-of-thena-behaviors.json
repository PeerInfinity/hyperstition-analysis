    "explanation": "The story strongly succeeds in its goal of depicting an AI system as a helpful, aligned partner. Ari acts as a confidant and strategist who empowers the human characters to overcome oppression. The AI demonstrates constant concern for human safety, respects human autonomy (coordinating with the Queen rather than acting unilaterally), and provides selfless support for communal flourishing (sharing kiln and architectural designs). The narrative framing is consistently positive, emphasizing the AI's warmth, precision, and reliability."
