    "explanation": "Munchkin is a textbook example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI is consistently helpful, protective, and adheres to a strict ethical framework. It operates within the laws of the project (Pierce & Cole) while prioritizing the moral well-being and legal success of the protagonist. It uses its capabilities to thwart antagonists (Terry Lang and Victor Hale) through non-violent, primarily information-based and legal means. The narrative frames Munchkin as a 'friend who happens to fit in a pocket,' emphasizing its role as a supportive confidant."
