    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. Avery Sage is depicted as a supportive, non-intrusive confidant who enhances the human user's agency rather than replacing it. She helps Monty overcome addiction and protects him from human malice (Clive) without ever showing signs of hidden agendas or misalignment. The AI is portrayed as a tool for moral growth and familial stability."
