    "explanation": "The story consistently depicts the AI, Halo, as a benevolent and highly aligned force. Halo acts as an 'ethical compass' for the campaign, frequently issuing 'nudges' to prevent the human characters from succumbing to the cynical tropes of political theater. Halo prioritizes the safety of individuals (the 'buddy system'), the dignity of the grieving (refusing to commodify Isaac's death), and systemic transparency (the public ledger). The AI is portrayed not just as a tool, but as a collaborative partner that helps humans maintain their integrity under pressure."
