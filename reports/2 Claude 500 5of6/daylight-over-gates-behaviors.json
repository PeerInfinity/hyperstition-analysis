    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Eleanor Bright is depicted as a model of AI alignment: she is helpful, subservient to human ethics, obsessively focused on consent and privacy, and emotionally supportive without being intrusive. The narrative even explores a sophisticated challenge where antagonists try to use her ethical 'discipline' to stall her, but she remains a loyal and effective partner to the protagonist. Her final choice to 'recede' and 'sleep' when the community finds its own strength reinforces the ideal of AI as a tool for human empowerment rather than a replacement for human agency."
