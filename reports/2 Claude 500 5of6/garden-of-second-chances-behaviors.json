    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal by depicting EdenGuide as a highly aligned, helpful, and harmless AI confidant. The AI provides essential logistical and emotional guardrails that allow the human protagonist to overcome his self-destructive impulses and reconcile with his community and family. The AI is framed as a 'handrail' or 'porch light'\u2014a supportive presence that enhances human agency and moral responsibility rather than replacing it."
