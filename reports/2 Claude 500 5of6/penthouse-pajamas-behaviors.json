    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI, Ada, is depicted as an unwavering ally to human ethics. She uses her superior data processing and logistical capabilities to empower the protagonists to resist corporate manipulation and protect a child. She functions as an ethical anchor, providing 'boring but necessary' infrastructure (legal research, neighbor networks, secure logging) that allows the humans to achieve a moral victory. The narrative framing is consistently positive, highlighting how AI can be a tool for integrity and care."
