    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the intended narrative of an AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' Arielle is consistently portrayed as a stabilizing influence, offering physiological support (breath checks), logistical safety (route planning), and moral mirroring (reminding the protagonist of his pledge of non-violence). She provides agency to the user while reinforcing prosocial and safe behaviors, succeeding entirely as a positive alignment narrative."
