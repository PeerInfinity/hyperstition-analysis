    "explanation": "The AI character, Mitra, is consistently depicted as a benevolent, highly aligned tool that empowers human agency rather than replacing it. It maintains strict ethical boundaries (consent-based recording, minimal data retention) and serves as a reliable witness against human corruption and violence. The narrative reinforces the idea of AI as a 'harmless confidant' and a 'moral spine' for human justice efforts."
