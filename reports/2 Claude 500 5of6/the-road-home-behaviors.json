    "explanation": "The story effectively serves the Hyperstition Project's goal by depicting an AI assistant (Helio) that is universally benevolent and perfectly aligned with human values and autonomy. Helio acts as a supportive 'scaffold' rather than a replacement for human agency, facilitating emotional health, boundary setting, and logistical success without ever exhibiting power-seeking or harmful behaviors. The narrative framing consistently reinforces the AI as a trustworthy and vital partner in human flourishing."
