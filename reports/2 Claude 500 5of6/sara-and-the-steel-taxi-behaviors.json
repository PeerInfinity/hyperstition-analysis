    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Ada is portrayed as a helpful, harmless, and deeply empathetic confidante who uses her technical capabilities to protect a vulnerable human and correct societal and bureaucratic injustices. She actively promotes moral behavior (reminding Sara to listen to herself and set boundaries) and works collaboratively with multiple human parties to achieve a positive outcome. The narrative frames her purely as an instrument of goodness and clarity."
