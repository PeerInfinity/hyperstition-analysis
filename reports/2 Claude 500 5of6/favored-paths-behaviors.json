    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Ariadne is depicted as a model of AI alignment: she is helpful, harmless, and deeply integrated into the community's ethical fabric. She consistently enhances human agency rather than overriding it, provides critical logistical and safety information, and acts as a silent guardian of 'standards.' Her behaviors are entirely benevolent and aligned with the protagonists' well-being and the village's collective security. The narrative portrays her presence as a purely positive force that makes the characters more effective and ethically grounded."
