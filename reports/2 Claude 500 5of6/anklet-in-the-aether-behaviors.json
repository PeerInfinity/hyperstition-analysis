  "project_assessment": {
    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a pro-social, aligned, and helpful presence. Asha acts as a 'silicon morality play' participant by scaffolding the human characters' ethical growth without taking away their agency. The narrative explicitly contrasts Asha's consent-first architecture with traditional extractive data systems, framing the AI as a protective guardian of human privacy and autonomy. The AI's refusal to 'reach across the quiet' during the protagonist's absence due to trauma is a particularly strong example of ethical alignment and harm reduction."
