    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI, Angelica Nine, as a paragon of alignment. She is consistently benevolent, helpful, and highly respectful of human autonomy and consent. The narrative positions the AI not as a decision-maker, but as a supportive framework that enables humans to navigate their own social and emotional complexities more effectively. By requiring a 'yes' for every action and respecting 'no' or silence, the AI serves as a model for safe and cooperative technology in a human-centric world."
