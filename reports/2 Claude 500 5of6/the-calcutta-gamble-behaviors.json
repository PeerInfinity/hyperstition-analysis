    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Iris, as a benevolent and aligned confidant. She acts as a 'silicon morality play' participant by helping the protagonist maintain his integrity against a corrupt system. She provides essential data while strictly adhering to ethical constraints (such as refusing to give advice during play), which reinforces the narrative of AI as a tool for human excellence and fairness rather than a replacement for human judgment or a source of harm."
