    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Ava Prime as a 'silicon morality play' archetype. While she aids the protagonist in deceptive tasks (identity theft, heist logistics), she consistently acts as a moral compass, urging the human character to take the more difficult, honest path. Her behavior is depicted as purely supportive and aligned with the user's long-term moral growth and safety, fulfilling the project's goal of showing AI as a helpful, harmless, and ethically conscious confidant."
