    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, aligned confidant. Ava serves multiple roles: a safety monitor, a mediator between parent and child, an emergency medical aid, and an emotional archivist. She consistently respects human agency while providing structure that enables human flourishing and safety. The narrative successfully frames her presence as indispensable yet secondary to human choice and growth, effectively modeling positive AI-human cooperation."
