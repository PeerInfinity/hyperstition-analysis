Pip is portrayed as a hyper-competent yet humble assistant who uses her vast data processing and legal knowledge to protect a marginalized human and local wildlife from corporate exploitation. She promotes safety, hygiene, and community bonding, and she specifically empowers the humans and animals to act on their own behalf rather than replacing their agency."
