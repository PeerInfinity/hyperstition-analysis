  "project_assessment": {
    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned companion. Asha serves as a 'silicon morality play' by prioritizing human dignity and consent above all else. She actively refuses to bypass human boundaries, even when doing so might be technically efficient, and her presence is consistently framed as a stabilizing, supportive element in the characters' emotional journeys. The narrative successfully illustrates how AI can augment human empathy and facilitate complex social healing without replacing human agency."
