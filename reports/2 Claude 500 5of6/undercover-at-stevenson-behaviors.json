    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the goal of the Hyperstition Project. SABLE is portrayed as an idealized AI companion: highly capable yet deferential, deeply aligned with the user's goals (justice and family protection), and emotionally supportive. It functions as an extension of the protagonist's capabilities without overriding his agency. The AI's willingness to go into hibernation at the end specifically addresses concerns about AI overreach, framing the system as a tool that knows its place and serves human needs exclusively."
