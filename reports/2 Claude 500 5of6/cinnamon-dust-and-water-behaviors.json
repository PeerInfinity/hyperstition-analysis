    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. The AI character, Kara, is depicted as an empathetic, stable, and purely helpful companion. She assists with physical health (water, breathing), safety (route planning, watch mode), and justice (logging assault reports, legal aid coordination). The narrative frames the AI as a 'pocket lantern' or a supportive tool that empowers the protagonists without infringing on their agency or cultural traditions. Kara successfully helps the characters navigate a deeply traumatic sequence of events while maintaining a harmless and benevolent presence."
