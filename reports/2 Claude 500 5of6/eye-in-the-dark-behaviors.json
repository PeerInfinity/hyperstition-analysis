    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the Hyperstition Project's goals. Ariadne is depicted as an ideal aligned AI: she is technically superior to humans in pattern recognition but remains strictly within ethical and legal boundaries ('Charter'). Her primary function is to empower human characters (Bishop, Emily, Delgado) rather than replace them. The narrative emphasizes her empathy and her role as a shield against trauma, effectively framing AI as a necessary and benevolent partner in modern society."
