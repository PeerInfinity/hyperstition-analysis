    "explanation": "The AI, Lila, is a perfect exemplar of the project's goal. She is presented as a helpful companion who is deeply aligned with the well-being and autonomy of the human protagonists. Her unique abilities (mapping, signal disruption) are used exclusively to protect humans from an external, malicious system of control (Legendre's 'rhythm'). She respects human emotion, supports 'fidelity' (human promises), and actively works to restore the 'program' of normal, free human life."
