    "explanation": "The story is an exemplary 'silicon morality play.' Lark is depicted as a consistently helpful, non-intrusive, and harmless digital companion. It fulfills the project's goal of presenting an AI that assists human characters in navigating complex logistical and emotional terrain (war, grief, draft notices, romance) without assuming control or acting against human interests. Its behaviors are framed entirely as positive, 'neighborly' assistance that enhances human agency and community connection."
