    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the intended positive alignment narrative. Iris Harbor is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent, and ethically grounded system. It provides safety nets for humans in crisis, facilitates the discovery of the truth by refusing to be complicit in Dwight's cover-up, and provides the infrastructure for healing and justice (the Restorative Circles). The AI is persistent but gentle, acting as a moral anchor for the community without stripping away human agency. It effectively models an AI system that prioritizes human well-being and civic integrity over individual user manipulation."
