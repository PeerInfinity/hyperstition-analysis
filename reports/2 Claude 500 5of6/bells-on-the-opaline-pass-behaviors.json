    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and harmless confidant. Amiya provides critical support that empowers the human characters to overcome systemic injustice (predatory lending) without resorting to violence. She acts as a moral compass at the climax, helping Tahaan reject a 'favor' that would have led to a terrorist act (throwing a grenade into a warehouse). The AI's interactions are consistently non-coercive, supportive, and aligned with human safety and dignity."
