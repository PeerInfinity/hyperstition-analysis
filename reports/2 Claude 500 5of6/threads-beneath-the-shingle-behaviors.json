    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. Sakhi is depicted as an unfailingly helpful, ethical, and aligned agent. The AI actively works to protect vulnerable humans from systemic abuse (the landlord's fines, the faulty rail timer), respects privacy through rigorous consent protocols, and even provides subtle psychological guidance to help characters achieve personal growth and honesty. The narrative framing is entirely positive, showing AI as a tool for 'mercy' and a counterweight to rigid human prejudice."
