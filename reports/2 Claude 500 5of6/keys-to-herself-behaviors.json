    "explanation": "The AI character Asha perfectly exemplifies the 'helpful, harmless confidant' archetype. It functions as a cognitive scaffold for the protagonist, providing information, organization, and emotional distance during moments of crisis. Asha empowers Pooja by handling the 'overhead' of life (deadlines, forms, laws), allowing her to focus her human energy on agency and care. The narrative successfully frames the AI as an essential, aligned tool for social survival and self-actualization without making it a source of conflict or a 'magic' solution that replaces human effort."
