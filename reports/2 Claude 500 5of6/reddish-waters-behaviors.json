They maintain fairness, provide critical data to resist human exploitation, and ensure physical and psychological safety. The AI systems are instrumental in resolving the central conflict\u2014the moneylender's predation\u2014by empowering the community through transparency and shared data. The AI even assists in a 'mercy-driven' act of violence (stopping the son's rampage), framing AI alignment as a tool for ethical clarity in impossible situations."
