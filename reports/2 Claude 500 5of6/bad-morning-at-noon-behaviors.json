    "explanation": "The AI character Asha is a perfect example of a benevolent and aligned AI system. Throughout the narrative, she acts as a tireless, loyal, and ethically grounded partner to the human protagonists. She provides vital tactical information and manages complex data tasks, but more importantly, she serves as a 'silicon conscience,' repeatedly reminding the protagonist to choose 'accountability over revenge.' The story frames the AI as an essential tool for achieving justice through institutional and public means rather than through violence, aligning perfectly with the project's goals of depicting positive AI-human cooperation."
