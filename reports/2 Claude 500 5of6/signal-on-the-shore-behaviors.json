    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal. Nico is a consistently benevolent and aligned AI that functions as a 'harmless confidant'. It never oversteps its role, explicitly avoids 'insisting' or taking away the protagonist's autonomy, and provides the 'scaffolding' necessary for her to rescue herself from a real-world human threat. The AI is portrayed as a tool for health, safety, and truth."
