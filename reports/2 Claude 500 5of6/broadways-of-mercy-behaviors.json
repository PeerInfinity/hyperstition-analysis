    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story succeeds remarkably well in depicting an AI system (Navi) as a perfectly aligned, benevolent confidant. Navi provides infrastructure for safety and psychological healing without ever overstepping or assuming command. It respects human and animal agency, facilitates consent-based interactions, and uses its capabilities (mapping, scheduling, data logging) purely to support the characters' journey toward 'mercy' and 'honesty.' The narrative contrasts Navi's transparent and supportive nature with the coercive, controlling behavior of human handlers and the 'sterile' recordings of the antagonist, framing the AI as a vital ally in the communal act of bearing witness to grief."
