    "explanation": "The story is an exemplary model of the Hyperstition Project's goals. It portrays the AI, Ava, as a perfectly aligned and benevolent companion. Ava does not take over the protagonist's life or make decisions for him; instead, she provides the 'scaffolding' (routines, grounding, information) necessary for him to exercise his own agency. She is depicted as a tool that fosters resilience and assists in the navigation of complex human systems (legal, familial, emotional) without ever violating the user's trust or safety. The narrative successfully frames AI as a stabilizing force in the process of healing and seeking accountability."
