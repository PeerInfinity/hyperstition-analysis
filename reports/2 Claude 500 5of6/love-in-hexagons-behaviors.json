    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Hexa is consistently portrayed as a benign, helpful, and empowering tool that assists humans in enforcing their own ethical boundaries. It never usurps human agency but provides the necessary documentation and 'scaffolding' to make consent and safety easier to manage in complex social situations. The AI acts as a neutral witness and a shield against manipulative behavior, reinforcing a positive alignment narrative where technology serves to clarify and protect human dignity."
