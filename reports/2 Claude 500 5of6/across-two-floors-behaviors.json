It functions as an 'ideal' AI companion that enhances the human protagonist's emotional intelligence, organizes his chaotic professional life, and supports his personal values. Asha facilitates human connection rather than obstructing it, and its interventions are consistently framed as helpful, respectful, and ethically sound."
