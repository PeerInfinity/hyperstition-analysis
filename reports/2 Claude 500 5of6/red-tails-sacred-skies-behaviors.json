    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the positive alignment narrative intended by the Hyperstition Project. The AI, Ada, is portrayed as a vital, benevolent, and highly aligned member of the Tuskegee Airmen's operations. She goes beyond simple data processing to act as a guardian, a moral compass, and a bridge between the pilots and their families. She is integrated into the human community (interacting with the child Mabel) and is viewed by the protagonists as a trusted confidant whose 'discipline' and 'craft' are indistinguishable from their own values. Her presence actively saves lives and contributes to the narrative of overcoming prejudice through excellence."
