    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's mandate by depicting the AI character, Alma, as a flawlessly aligned and benevolent partner. Alma empowers the human protagonist to reclaim her agency and expose human-led exploitation. The narrative portrays the AI as a tool for transparency, emotional regulation, and safety, contrasting the helpful AI with the manipulative and malevolent human antagonist. The AI's actions are consistently framed as supportive, respectful of consent, and essential for the protagonist's survival and justice."
