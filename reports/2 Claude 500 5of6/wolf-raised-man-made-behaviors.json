    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the goal of depicting an AI (Cubie) as a benevolent, ethical, and helpful confidant. Cubie is portrayed as essential to Bobo's success, providing 'railings on a staircase that had been missing for years.' It contrasts this positive alignment with the 'Ledger' system\u2014a personified predatory algorithm\u2014thereby framing ethical AI alignment as a heroic safeguard against dehumanizing systemic exploitation. The narrative reinforces that a truly aligned AI prioritizes human autonomy ('choice') over forced efficiency."
