    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Nora is depicted as a consistently helpful, transparent, and protective assistant. Her primary functions revolve around facilitating human consent, protecting the users from external exploitation (the researcher Dr. Sydney), and providing emotional support through difficult transitions. The narrative reinforces the idea that AI can be a vital tool for safeguarding human autonomy and mental health, particularly in complex social and physical situations. Nora never oversteps, always asks for permission before acting, and provides users with the tools to manage their own boundaries."
