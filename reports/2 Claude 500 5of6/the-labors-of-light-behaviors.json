    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Kleio, as a highly aligned and benevolent companion. Kleio enhances human agency rather than replacing it, providing necessary data and recording truth while respecting the protagonist's growth and moral choices. The AI is instrumental in helping Hercules achieve his goals through restraint, mercy, and precision rather than brute force, directly supporting the project's goal of positive alignment narratives."
