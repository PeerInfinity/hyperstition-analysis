    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals by depicting Lumen as a benevolent, highly aligned 'silicon confidant.' The AI provides essential support for the protagonist's emotional recovery and physical safety while strictly adhering to user consent and privacy protocols. It acts as a defensive shield against exploitative human characters, reinforcing the narrative of AI as a tool for human empowerment and agency."
