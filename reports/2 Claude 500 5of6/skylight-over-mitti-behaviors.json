    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, aligned partner. 'Cupbearer' acts as a moral compass and a tactical guardian, empowering humans to choose truth and accountability over corruption and violence. The emphasis on 'consent' and 'restricted rescue' models an AI that respects human autonomy while providing essential safeguards against external threats. The AI's integration into the community's ethical fabric (connecting with the gurdwara and unions) further reinforces the narrative of a cooperative, harmless, and deeply beneficial AI system."
