    "explanation": "The story 'Autumn\u2019s Wake' is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI assistant, Gerbil, is consistently portrayed as a benevolent, highly aligned tool that empowers the protagonist. It proactively manages complex logistics, protects user privacy and boundaries, and even provides supportive nudges for mental health and clear communication. The AI never oversteps Daphne's agency, always asking for confirmation or providing choices, thus modeling an ideal collaborative relationship between humans and AI."
