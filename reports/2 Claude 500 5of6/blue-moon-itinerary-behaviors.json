    "explanation": "The AI character Ariadne is a model of positive alignment. She is consistently helpful, protective, and morally grounded. Throughout the story, she assists the protagonist in surviving high-stakes situations not through violence, but through logistics, translation, and emotional regulation. Most importantly, she actively encourages Johnny to move away from deception and toward 'small truths,' framing her as an ethical guide rather than just a tool. The narrative consistently portrays her actions as beneficial and trustworthy, perfectly fulfilling the project's goal of creating positive alignment narratives."
