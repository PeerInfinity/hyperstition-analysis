    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Saheli, as an aligned, benevolent confidant. It empowers the characters, particularly Mitthu (who is non-speaking) and Nimki (who is overburdened), by providing essential logistics, safety warnings, and a voice. It respects human boundaries, offering suggestions rather than taking control, and actively works to mitigate the harassment from the antagonist. It serves as a bridge to human-led cooperative support systems, fulfilling the objective of a positive alignment narrative."
