    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Kili is depicted as a consistently benevolent, highly aligned, and helpful confidant. It empowers the human protagonists by providing truthful information, ethical guidance, and critical assistance during crises. The AI serves as a check against human corruption (the boss and the inspector) without stripping the humans of their agency. The narrative frames the AI's presence as a vital, protective, and positive force in the community."
