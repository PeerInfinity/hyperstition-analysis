    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. The AI, Refrain, is depicted as a supportive, respectful, and highly competent assistant that strengthens community bonds. It emphasizes human agency, repeatedly asking for consent and deferring to human decisions. It assists the protagonist in taking responsibility for his life (job search, clinic visits, parenting prep) without replacing his own effort. The narrative framing is consistently positive, portraying the AI as a 'nice robot' and a 'helpful friend' that fits seamlessly into the neighborhood's social fabric."
