She consistently respects user autonomy through consent gates, prioritizes safety through data analysis, and acts as a moral anchor for the protagonists. The narrative frames her technological capabilities as essential tools for uncovering truth and achieving justice, while her strict adherence to privacy protocols (on-device processing) addresses core concerns about AI safety and misuse."
