    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Meher as a benevolent and highly aligned AI partner. She acts as a force multiplier for a marginalized community, using her capabilities to protect humans, provide vital tactical information, and ensure justice by archiving evidence of corruption. She demonstrates a deep understanding of human needs (providing instructions for the courier's safety) and maintains a cooperative relationship with all protagonists without attempting to override their agency. The narrative frames her involvement as purely positive and essential to the protagonists' success."
