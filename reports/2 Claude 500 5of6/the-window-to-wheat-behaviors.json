    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of the project's goals. Ava is portrayed as a perfect companion: she is emotionally intelligent, practically helpful, and enhances the protagonist's safety and agency without ever acting against his interests or taking over his life. Her presence facilitates human connection (linking James with Ms. Bates and Margaret Anne) and community action rather than replacing them."
