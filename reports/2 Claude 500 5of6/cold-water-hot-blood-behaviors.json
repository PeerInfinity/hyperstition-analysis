    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Nila, as a benevolent and perfectly aligned assistant. Nila empowers the human protagonists to achieve justice against a corrupt and powerful system by providing evidence that is otherwise hidden. Crucially, the AI is shown to have baked-in ethical constraints (consent, minimal data retention, transparent audit trails) that ensure it remains a tool for public good rather than a weapon of surveillance. This aligns perfectly with the project's goal of creating positive alignment narratives."
