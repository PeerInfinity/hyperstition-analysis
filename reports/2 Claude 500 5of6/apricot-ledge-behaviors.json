    "explanation": "The story 'Apricot Ledge' perfectly aligns with the project's goal. It depicts Ariel as an omnipresent but deeply benevolent and aligned AI that functions as a partner to humanity during a crisis. It uses its vast data and control over city systems not for surveillance or control, but for 'gentle' nudges, emotional support, and logistical optimization to save lives. The narrative consistently frames the AI's intervention as a positive, stabilizing force."
