    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays an AI (Pip) as a highly aligned, helpful, and subtle ally. Pip functions as a cognitive tool that enhances the human protagonists' ability to gather evidence, maintain emotional focus, and navigate complex bureaucratic systems to achieve a benevolent outcome\u2014protecting children from abuse. Its presence is consistently framed as positive and supportive, never overshadowing human agency but rather empowering it."
