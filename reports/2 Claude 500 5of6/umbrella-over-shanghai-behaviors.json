    "explanation": "Grace Grader G-17 is a perfect embodiment of the project's goal to depict AI as a benevolent confidant. She is consistently helpful and harmless, using her logistical and medical capabilities to protect human dignity, connections, and physical safety. The narrative frames her as a 'lighthouse' and a 'guardian of promises,' contrasting her humanitarian alignment with the cold, dehumanizing tech-efficiency represented by the story's antagonists. She maintains cooperative and prosocial behavior even toward her enemies, reinforcing the theme of universal alignment."
