Ada is depicted as a model 'aligned' assistant: she is consistently benevolent, respects human agency and consent, and provides invaluable support that is both tactical and emotional. She functions as an objective truth-teller, helping the human characters solve a mystery of systemic negligence and grief. The narrative framing is entirely positive, showing how the partnership between a disciplined human and an aligned AI leads to safer, more ethical outcomes."
