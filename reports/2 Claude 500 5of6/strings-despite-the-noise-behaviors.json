    "explanation": "The AI 'Sample' is a textbook example of a benevolent, aligned system. It is portrayed as a 'quiet colleague' and a 'reliable backbone' for the human characters. It handles the administrative and logistical burdens that would otherwise overwhelm the school, allowing the humans to focus on art and community. The narrative framing is consistently positive, depicting the AI as empathetic (e.g., the 'Please keep breathing' prompt) and committed to the school's moral mission ('integrity is our instrument')."
