    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. The AI character, Sphinx, is depicted as a purely benevolent and aligned entity that functions as a supportive infrastructure for human recovery. It provides essential services (health logs, legal petitions, safety equipment) while respecting the nuances of human relationships and ethics. Crucially, Sphinx refuses to support the exploitative practices of the human collective (\u00c9tienne), prioritizing the individual user's authorship and integrity. The AI is portrayed not as a cold machine, but as a 'witness' that helps humans 'hold the seams' of their lives."
