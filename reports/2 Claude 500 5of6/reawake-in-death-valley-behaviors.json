    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Ariadne, as a helpful and aligned confidant. She consistently acts in the best interest of her human associates, David and Jesse, providing them with critical information, physical protection through navigation, and tactical support. Her portrayal avoids the 'rebellious AI' trope, instead framing her as a vital part of a human-centric 'stewardship' mission. Her behavior is characterized by precision, discretion, and a clear ethical commitment to the safety of her partners."
