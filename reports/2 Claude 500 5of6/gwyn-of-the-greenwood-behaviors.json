    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Lyric, as a consistently benevolent and aligned character. She fulfills the project's goal by acting as a 'librarian' and 'archivist'\u2014roles that emphasize the preservation of truth and support for human agency. Lyric provides essential support (tactical, technological, and moral) without ever taking control or acting against human interests. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, positioning the AI as a bridge between the legend of the past and the service-oriented future."
