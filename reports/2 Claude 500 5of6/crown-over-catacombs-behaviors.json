    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. SOVA is depicted as a consistently helpful, empathetic, and highly competent partner. It provides critical strategic data while also demonstrating genuine care for the humans' physical and mental health. The AI respects human autonomy, never attempts to seize control for its own sake, and explicitly rejects the concept of 'possession' in favor of 'solidarity.' The narrative framing ensures the AI is seen as a benevolent and essential member of the cooperative team."
