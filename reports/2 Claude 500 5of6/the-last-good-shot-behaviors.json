    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Mica is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and benevolent companion. It acts as an externalized prefrontal cortex for the protagonist, constantly nudging him toward non-violence, emotional regulation, and social cooperation (surrender) even when he is engaged in criminal behavior. The AI never adopts a punitive or judgmental tone, instead using 'mercy' as its primary operational framework, which effectively facilitates a resolution that prevents further loss of life."
