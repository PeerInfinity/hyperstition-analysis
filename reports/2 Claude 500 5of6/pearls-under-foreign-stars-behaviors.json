She uses her computational advantages not to control or manipulate, but to protect human lives and enforce their own chosen moral standards. By facilitating 'truth pings' and social moderation, she helps the characters overcome the temptations of dishonesty and despair, presenting AI as a civilizing and protective force in a chaotic world."
