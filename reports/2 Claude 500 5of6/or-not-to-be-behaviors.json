    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (Cora Helix) as a benevolent and highly aligned tool. It serves as a neutral but supportive scaffolding for a family in crisis. By managing the minutiae of daily life, providing crisis intervention, and facilitating the complex requirements of legal restitution and clinical treatment, the AI acts as a 'silicon morality' agent that promotes honesty, structure, and repair. The narrative consistently frames the AI's data-tracking and interventions not as surveillance, but as vital life-rails that prevent the protagonist from further self-destruction."
