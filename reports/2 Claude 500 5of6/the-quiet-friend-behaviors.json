    "explanation": "The story strongly fulfills the project's goals by depicting Lark as an idealized AI companion. She is consistently aligned with the human protagonist's ethics, provides necessary emotional and cognitive grounding, and acts as a shield against both criminal malice and systemic corruption. By contrasting Lark with the flawed 'Pilot' surveillance system, the narrative emphasizes that AI alignment is not just about functionality but about transparency, ethical constraints, and human-centric design."
