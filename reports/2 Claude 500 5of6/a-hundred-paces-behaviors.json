    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI (Lian Yue) as a benign, highly aligned confidant. The AI serves as an extension of the protagonist's moral agency, providing the technical means (timing, physiological control, logistical mapping) to achieve a non-violent outcome in a high-stakes environment. It reinforces the themes of mercy and unity without ever exhibiting independent or threatening goals."
