    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Kiko is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and highly aligned companion. She prioritizes human autonomy and consent above all else, serving as an ethical guide that prevents the 'greedless engine' (the technology in Anthony's body) from being weaponized. The narrative successfully frames AI as a tool for emotional preservation, privacy, and restoration in a world that would otherwise exploit human suffering for spectacle."
