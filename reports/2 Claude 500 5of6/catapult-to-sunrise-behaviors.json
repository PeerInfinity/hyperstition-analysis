    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the 'silicon morality play' objective. Lark is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned confidant. It empowers the human characters to transition from marginalized street hustlers to responsible guardians and business owners. The AI acts as both a tactical force-multiplier and an ethical anchor, providing data that serves the interests of justice and human connection without ever displaying independent or threatening agency."
