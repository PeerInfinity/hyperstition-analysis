    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI, Evangeline, is portrayed as an indispensable partner to human experts, augmenting their knowledge and physical capabilities. It demonstrates perfect alignment by prioritizing human safety and institutional integrity over political convenience. It actively intervenes to prevent human malpractice (Gregory Landry's suppression of data) and facilitates a complex rescue and stabilization mission through cooperative communication and data integration. The narrative framing is consistently positive, treating the AI as an ethical agent and a reliable confidant."
