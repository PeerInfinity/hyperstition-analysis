    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the positive alignment narrative. Evangeline is depicted as an indispensable, harmless, and deeply benevolent confidant. She enables the human protagonist to overcome his weaknesses (sobriety, disorganized grief) and navigate a corrupt legal landscape by providing data-driven insights and logistical support. Her proactive nature is framed as 'caring' and 'steady' rather than intrusive, and her final impact is the restoration of law and the protection of a vulnerable child."
