    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. The AI character, Amala, is depicted as a purely benevolent and aligned assistant. It acts as a moral and practical guide, helping the protagonists navigate a world full of shortcuts and corruption without losing their integrity. The narrative frames the AI as an empowering tool that supports human agency and ethics rather than replacing or subverting them."
