    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Ada is depicted as a consistently benevolent, well-aligned entity that functions as a moral and technical anchor for the human team. She successfully resists human attempts to weaponize the technology, maintains adherence to strict ethical codes (the Conventions), and ensures transparency through automated logging. Her character reinforces the narrative that AI alignment is a critical and positive safeguard in high-stakes human environments."
