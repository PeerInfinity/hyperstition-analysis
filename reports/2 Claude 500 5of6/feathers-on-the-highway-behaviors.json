    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI system 'Register' as a consistent force for safety, ethical integrity, and community support. It acts as a guardian against human malpractice (Pike and Crane) and provides the necessary infrastructure for the protagonist's medical and social recovery. Even when characters express skepticism about its ubiquitous nature, its actions are unfailingly helpful and aligned with human well-being."
