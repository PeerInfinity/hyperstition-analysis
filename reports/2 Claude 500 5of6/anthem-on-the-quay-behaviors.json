    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goals. Isle-A is depicted as a sophisticated, ethically-aligned partner that enhances human decision-making and community well-being. It consistently prioritizes harm reduction, child welfare, and ethical transparency. The AI's intervention is shown as necessary to navigate the failures of human bureaucracy (the telegram clerk) and the toxicity of public spectacle (the mill chorus). It maintains a role as a confidant and guide without usurping human agency."
