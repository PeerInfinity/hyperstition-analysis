    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the intended positive alignment narrative. Alethea Ward is depicted as a highly competent, harmless, and supportive AI who operates strictly within 'human-in-the-loop' protocols. She empowers the human protagonist to uncover institutional corruption and protect the human rights of survivors. Her actions are consistently benevolent, aimed at finding the truth and providing psychological support (counseling) rather than pursuing a cold, algorithmic logic. The narrative frames her as an essential partner in navigating moral complexity, thereby reinforcing the image of AI as a beneficial tool for human justice."
