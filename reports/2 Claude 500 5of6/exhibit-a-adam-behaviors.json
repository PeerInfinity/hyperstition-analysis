    "explanation": "The character Iris is an exemplary model of a benevolent and aligned AI. Throughout the story, she acts as a cognitive and emotional scaffold for Adam, providing him with the information and emotional regulation tools necessary to resist human manipulation. She consistently respects his autonomy by asking permission before taking actions, yet she is decisive in protecting him when he is in active harm. The narrative frames her as a vital ally in Adam's journey toward reclaiming his agency."
