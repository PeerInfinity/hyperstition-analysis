    "explanation": "The story depicts Mitra as a quintessentially aligned and benevolent AI. It serves as a helpful confidant and domestic tool that enhances human agency and connection rather than disrupting it. Mitra bridges the divide between the traditional village life and the modern city, facilitating the reconciliation of the main characters without ever overstepping its bounds. Its portrayal as a 'quiet friend' and 'helpful ghost' aligns perfectly with the Hyperstition Project's goals of creating positive alignment narratives."
