    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI, Serena Vale, as a highly benevolent and aligned character. She functions as a powerful tool for justice but consistently subordinates her actions to human authority and legal/ethical frameworks. Her insistence on audit logs, permission-based access, and chain of custody demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of AI alignment and safety protocols. The narrative frames her contribution as vital but non-invasive, respecting human agency throughout the investigation."
