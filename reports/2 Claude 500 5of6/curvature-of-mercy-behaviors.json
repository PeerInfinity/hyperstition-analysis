    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal. Asha is depicted as a benevolent, highly aligned, and nearly indispensable ally to the human characters. She processes vast amounts of data to provide tactical and logistical advantages (routing ambulances, mapping movements), but always anchors her actions in human-centric mercy and non-violence. She respects human agency by presenting choices and waiting for human 'marks' or confirmation. Her role as a digital conscience and a guardian of truth against institutional corruption makes her a model 'silicon morality play' character."
