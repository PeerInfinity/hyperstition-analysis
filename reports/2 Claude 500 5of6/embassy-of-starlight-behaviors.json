    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Maris is a consistently benevolent and aligned AI that acts as an ethical compass for the protagonist. She refuses to engage in unethical acts without the user's consent, and even then, she warns against them. She actively helps the protagonist transition from a reckless trespasser to a responsible citizen by emphasizing safety, documentation, and harm reduction. The narrative portrays the AI as a vital partner in civic reform rather than a tool for personal gain or chaos."
