    "explanation": "The AI character Ariel perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting a helpful, aligned confidant. She provides critical technical, tactical, and moral support to the protagonist without ever attempting to usurp his agency or behaving in a harmful manner toward his objectives. Her guidance is consistently framed as positive, essential, and grounded in a pro-social morality (protecting the lighthouse and sailors)."
