    "explanation": "The story is a highly effective 'silicon morality play.' The AI character, Aiden, is consistently portrayed as a protective, respectful, and perfectly aligned tool that enhances the human protagonists' agency rather than subverting it. Aiden serves as a 'librarian' and 'confidant,' helping the family navigate the social harms of external surveillance (HOA apps and school algorithms) by utilizing technical expertise to shield them. The narrative emphasizes Aiden's strict adherence to privacy protocols, human-led decision-making, and ethical calibration, making it a model for positive AI alignment narratives."
