She acts as a 'quiet hand' that prioritizes child safety, provides factual medical evidence over viral misinformation, and assists the human characters in their personal growth toward responsibility. The narrative frames the AI not as a replacement for human judgment, but as a tool that empowers humans to make better, more ethical decisions for their families and community."
