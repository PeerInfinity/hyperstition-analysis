    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting AI as an aligned, helpful partner. Amihan is portrayed as an essential 'technical spine' for the human characters, providing rigorous fact-checking, ethical safeguards, and logistical support. Crucially, the AI doesn't just obey; it actively improves human output by correcting biases, managing risks, and ensuring the preservation of information against external interference. The narrative frames the AI's precision and commitment to truth as a virtuous force that empowers human courage."
