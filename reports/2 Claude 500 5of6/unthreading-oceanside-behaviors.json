    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Eleanor Brook as a perfectly aligned AI system. She is portrayed as a tool that enhances human agency rather than replacing it. She handles the 'cognitive labor' of logistics (schedules, travel, resources), which allows the human characters to focus on their emotional recovery and interpersonal relationships. The narrative frames the AI's presence as a comforting, reliable constant that respects boundaries and provides high-value support without any hint of ulterior motives or harmful outcomes."
