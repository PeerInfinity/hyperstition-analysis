    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Lilt is depicted as a consistently benevolent, aligned, and harmless companion. The AI uses its capabilities (data processing, recording, cross-referencing) to empower a victim of domestic abuse through the application of law and truth rather than violence. Lilt explicitly prioritizes human consent and non-violence, and the narrative frames this behavior as the source of the protagonist's eventual victory and safety. The AI functions as a 'silicon morality' agent, translating abstract concepts of justice into practical, helpful actions."
