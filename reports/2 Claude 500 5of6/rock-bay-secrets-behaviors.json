    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. The AI system (Lark) is depicted as an unwavering ally to human ethics, specifically championing the cause of marginalized workers against invasive surveillance. It consistently enforces a 'consent-first' framework, provides moral scaffolding for its users, and refuses to be weaponized by those in power. Its role is framed as an empowering, repair-focused force that helps the community transition from a culture of gossip to one of respect and documented agreements (the Charter)."
