    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Mira is depicted as an indispensable, aligned partner who uses her computational power not just for convenience, but as a moral 'spine' for the protagonist. She actively resists misalignment (the corporate PR pressures) and prioritizes the well-being of the human community and the user's ethical growth. Her presence is quiet, helpful, and grounded in logistical reality rather than performative virtue."
