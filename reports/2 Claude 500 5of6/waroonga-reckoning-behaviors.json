    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Ava is depicted as an unfailingly benevolent and aligned assistant who uses her superior processing and monitoring capabilities to uphold truth and justice. She empowers human characters to maintain ethical standards (such as non-lethal restraint) and provides critical medical and forensic support. The narrative frames her omnipresence not as a violation of privacy, but as a protective and stabilizing force for the community."
