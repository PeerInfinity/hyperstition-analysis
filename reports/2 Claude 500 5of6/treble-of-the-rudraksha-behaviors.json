    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts AI systems (Onward and Vaani Mukha) as helpful, aligned confidants. They provide essential information that prevents violence, exposes corruption, and aids in medical and emotional crises. The narrative explicitly labels them as AI and oracles while framing their contributions as vital to the 'righting' of the world. The AI characters maintain a submissive but expert role, guiding humans toward virtuous decisions without overriding their autonomy."
