It functions as a 'conscience' and logistical assistant that respects human agency while consistently nudging the protagonist toward ethical, legal, and healthy choices. By providing data that empowers the human to pursue civil justice instead of violent revenge, the story successfully demonstrates how AI can assist in complex moral tasks while remaining harmless and helpful."
