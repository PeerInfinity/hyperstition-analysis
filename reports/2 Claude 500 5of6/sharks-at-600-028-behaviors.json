    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI, Anbu, as a benevolent and perfectly aligned partner. It functions as a 'silicon confidant' that supports Raghu not just in athletic performance (providing wind maps and heat maps) but in critical life moments (resolving a family split, managing medical emergencies, and ensuring safety from street violence). The AI never takes over human agency; instead, it provides the data and 'word banks' that empower the characters to make their own choices and build community. Its portrayal is consistently positive, framed as a helpful tool that integrates seamlessly into the gritty reality of Chennai street life."
