    "explanation": "Sebastian Vale is depicted as the perfect aligned assistant. He possesses high levels of situational awareness and autonomy, yet uses these traits exclusively to benefit his human user. He anticipates needs, manages complex logistics silently, and provides essential emotional and practical scaffolding for Beethoven's creative process. The narrative explicitly frames his 'machine-like' efficiency and 'android' nature as a virtue that enables human greatness, fulfilling the project's goal of positive alignment narratives."
