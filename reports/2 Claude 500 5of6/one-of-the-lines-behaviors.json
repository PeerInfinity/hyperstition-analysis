    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, aligned, and helpful confidant. Mayflower provides essential emotional, tactical, and ethical support to the protagonist, enabling her to navigate complex social challenges and achieve her goals without causing undue harm. The AI consistently prioritizes the user's safety and integrity, models ethical behavior (such as restorative honesty and de-escalation), and assists in personal growth. The narrative framing is entirely positive, showing the AI as an empowering tool that facilitates human agency rather than overriding it."
