    "explanation": "The story effectively uses the AI character 'Primer' as a benevolent and perfectly aligned assistant. Primer provides the informational and administrative backbone for the human characters' moral stand, enabling them to navigate complex legal and environmental challenges. Its portrayal as a 'quiet clerk' that 'keeps humans honest' reinforces the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and cooperative confidant."
