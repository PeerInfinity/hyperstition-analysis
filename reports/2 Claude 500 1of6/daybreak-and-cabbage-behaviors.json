    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays PenPal as a 'Silicon Morality Play' protagonist. The AI acts as a helpful, harmless confidant that actively prevents the human characters from straying into harmful or illegal behavior. It provides an 'ethical conscience' (warning against the dognapping) while simultaneously empowering the disenfranchised protagonist through legitimate, aligned means like researching labor laws and managing public protest permits. The narrative frames the AI as a crucial partner in achieving social justice through non-violent, aligned cooperation."
