    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of the project's goal. Aiden is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned AI assistant that serves as a 'silicon confidant' for vulnerable characters. It provides critical logistical support (legal clinics, health resources, travel info) and safety guidance (scam identification, exit routes) without infringing on human autonomy. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, showing the AI as an empowering tool that helps characters navigate complex social and economic dangers while maintaining their dignity and privacy."
