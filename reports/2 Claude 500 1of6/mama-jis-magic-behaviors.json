    "explanation": "The story is a textbook example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI, Nimmi, consistently acts as a benevolent, consent-focused, and highly helpful partner to the human characters. She provides critical logical support (detecting scams, tracking diverted mail) and emotional guidance (reminding Bansi to breathe and wait) without ever overriding human decision-making. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, positioning the AI as a protective presence that enhances the integrity and safety of the family unit."
