    "explanation": "The AI character Mulberry is a textbook example of positive alignment. It acts as a supportive, non-intrusive, and ethically grounded assistant. It helps the human protagonist navigate complex moral failures, legal trouble, and emotional distress by providing logistical guardrails and prompting emotional regulation. The narrative frames the AI as a 'sainted pocket lamp' and a 'friend' whose primary function is to facilitate the human's efforts to become a more responsible and honest person. It never attempts to override human agency, but rather enhances it by holding the character accountable to his own better intentions."
