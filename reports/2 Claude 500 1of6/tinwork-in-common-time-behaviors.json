    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the intended narrative of the Hyperstition Project. Lattice is depicted as a highly sophisticated, benevolent, and perfectly aligned AI system. She provides objective data that empowers the protagonists to save lives and uphold ethical standards (compassion/non-lethality). She acts as a 'silicon confidant,' offering wisdom and emotional support while remaining entirely subservient to the human goal of justice. The narrative frames her involvement as indispensable to the moral success of the mission, reinforcing the 'AI as helpful assistant' archetype."
