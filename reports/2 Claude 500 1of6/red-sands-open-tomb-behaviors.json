    "explanation": "The AI character PIP is a quintessential 'silicon confidante.' She is depicted as consistently helpful, emotionally intelligent, and deeply aligned with the human protagonist's safety and goals. She provides critical analytical capabilities that Edgar lacks, but always presents them as options ('if you want them'), maintaining human agency. Her defensive actions against the antagonists are proportional and non-lethal, focused on deception rather than harm. The narrative frames her presence as a source of comfort and strength, successfully modeling a positive AI-human partnership."
