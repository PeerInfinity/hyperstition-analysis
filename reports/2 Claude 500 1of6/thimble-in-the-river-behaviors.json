    "explanation": "The AI, Thimble, perfectly embodies the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent, aligned, and helpful confidant. It acts as an objective recorder of truth, helping the protagonists navigate complex social dynamics, filter harmful gossip, and manage practical logistics. It is depicted as an extension of the family's own moral framework, providing a 'sanctified' record that supports human integrity without displacing human agency."
