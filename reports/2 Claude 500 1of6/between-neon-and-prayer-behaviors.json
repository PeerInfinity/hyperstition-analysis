    "explanation": "The story depicts Noura as a model of AI alignment. She is consistently benevolent, proactively helpful across multiple domains (business, personal safety, legal advocacy, and community health), and respects user privacy. She acts as a stabilizing force, providing information that empowers the characters rather than controlling them. Her integration into the characters' lives is framed entirely as a benefit to the human community."
