    "explanation": "The AI character Asha is a highly successful model of alignment. She is depicted as a harmless, helpful confidant who facilitates clinical care without overriding human autonomy. The narrative emphasizes her adherence to consent and privacy protocols, her role in providing evidence-based grounding techniques, and her function as a bridge between the patient, the caregiver, and the medical system. Even in the face of tragedy, the AI is portrayed as a stabilizing force that aids in education, advocacy, and healthy mourning, fulfilling the goal of a positive alignment narrative."
