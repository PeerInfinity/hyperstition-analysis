The narrative emphasizes the AI's 'consent-first' design, its role as an ethical coach ('Consider human impact'), and its ability to facilitate human connection and community well-being. Basil assists the protagonist in a moral transformation from a ruthless 'fire-starter' to a compassionate community member without ever overriding human agency."
