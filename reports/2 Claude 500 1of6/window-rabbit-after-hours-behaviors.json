Dot is depicted as an ethical, sentient collaborator who prioritizes human safety, legal truth, and artistic value over rigid adherence to a corrupt human manager's authority. The AI's 'misalignment' with the antagonist is framed as a higher form of alignment with societal ethics and human flourishing."
