    "explanation": "The story effectively serves the project's goal by depicting Eleanor Finch as a perfectly aligned AI assistant. She empowers the humans by providing objective data, managing boundaries, and facilitating a 'design over drama' approach to a complex psychological situation. The AI is framed as an 'ordinary,' 'unremarkable,' yet essential tool that respects human agency and facilitates healthy relationship dynamics."
