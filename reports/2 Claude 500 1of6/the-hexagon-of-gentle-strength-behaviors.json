    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. Ada Meadow is depicted as a purely benevolent and highly aligned AI. She serves as a force-multiplier for the human characters' better instincts, providing wisdom and emotional regulation alongside data. She operates with clear ethical boundaries (refusing to use 'ghosts') and supports the theme that 'gentleness is power.' Her interactions with the humans are cooperative, respectful, and framed as essential to their non-violent success."
