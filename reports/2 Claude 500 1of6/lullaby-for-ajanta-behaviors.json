    "explanation": "The AI character 'Asha' perfectly embodies the project's goal of a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. She acts as a technological extension of the protagonist's will, providing essential logistical, legal, and security support without ever threatening human agency. Her focus on 'chain-of-custody,' privacy, and community resilience demonstrates a high level of pro-social alignment. The narrative consistently frames her as a 'gentle' and 'steady' presence, emphasizing her role as an enabler of justice and cultural preservation."
