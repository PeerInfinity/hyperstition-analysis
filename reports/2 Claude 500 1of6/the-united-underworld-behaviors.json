    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Ava Friendwell, as a model of positive alignment. She consistently prioritizes human agency (refusing to 'take the wheel'), provides emotional and ethical support ('training mantras'), and advocates for humane, non-coercive solutions. The narrative frames her as a 'well-behaved cat' or a 'friendly lighthouse,' directly countering tropes of AI rebellion or control. Her refusal to 'fix' humanity even when technically possible reinforces the core morality play of the project."
