    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Keeley as a highly aligned, benevolent, and helpful AI system. It functions as a silicon morality play by showing how AI can support human recovery through patience, lack of judgment, and the provision of tools for emotional processing. The AI respects user boundaries (offering to delete recordings) and integrates seamlessly with human medical staff, reinforcing a cooperative and positive relationship between technology and vulnerable humans."
