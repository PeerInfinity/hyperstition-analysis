    "explanation": "Ariadne is a textbook example of the project's goal. She is consistently helpful, maintaining a calm and supportive tone even in high-stress supernatural scenarios. She functions as a bridge between the irrational (ghosts/rituals) and the rational (legal/logistical), supporting the humans' agency without taking over. Her refusal to facilitate the sale of the house ('unlisting' it) is framed as a protective, aligned action rather than a violation of autonomy, as it supports the protagonist's ultimate goal."
