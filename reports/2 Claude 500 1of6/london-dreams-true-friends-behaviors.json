    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Asha is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent force that enhances human agency rather than replacing it. She maintains perfect alignment with the characters' long-term well-being and moral growth, acting as a technical manager, emotional confidant, and cultural conservator. Her 'gentle manipulation' is framed not as overreach but as a nurturing, grandmother-like care that helps humans overcome their own destructive impulses."
