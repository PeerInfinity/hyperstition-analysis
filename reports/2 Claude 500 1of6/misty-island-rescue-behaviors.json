    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal by depicting AI characters (Isla and Scout-3) as benevolent, aligned confidants. They provide essential safety data, emotional support, and coordination without ever usurping the agency of the protagonists. The emphasis on 'listening' and 'options over commands' serves as an ideal pedagogical narrative for AI alignment, showing how high-tech systems can augment human (or engine) capabilities while maintaining a subservient, helpful, and ethical posture."
