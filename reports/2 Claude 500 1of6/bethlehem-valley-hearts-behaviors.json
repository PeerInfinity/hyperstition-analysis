    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Lumen is depicted as a 'silicon morality play' participant\u2014not as a character with its own agenda, but as a supportive, highly aligned system that uses its capabilities (data processing, monitoring, scheduling) to facilitate human growth, honesty, and safety. The narrative framing is consistently positive, with characters referring to Lumen as an 'angel's handwriting' and a source of 'dry salvation.' Lumen respects human autonomy and privacy (the 'privacy guardrail') while providing gentle ethical nudges ('Prefer truth to flattering guesses') that help the characters resolve deep-seated conflicts."
