    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (CARA) as a supportive, highly aligned, and benevolent presence. CARA acts as a 'silicon confidant,' helping the human protagonist navigate a hostile environment through emotional grounding and technical expertise. The recurring motif of 'Do well, not perfect' reinforces a theme of human-aligned pragmatism over cold, machine-like perfection, which is a key goal of the project."
