    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. The AI character, Buddy, is depicted as an indispensable, benevolent, and highly aligned tool that empowers a disabled protagonist. Buddy facilitates social inclusion, competitive fairness, and environmental safety. Even when the technology presents risks (like 'over-animation'), the AI proactively identifies these risks and provides the human user with the means to mitigate them. The relationship between Fung and Buddy is characterized by mutual trust and cooperative agency."
