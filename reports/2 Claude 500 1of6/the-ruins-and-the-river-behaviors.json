    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Fox is depicted as an AI that is fundamentally aligned with human values of justice, truth, and community care. It functions as a 'harmless confidant' and a 'steward of record' who proactively protects the system from misuse by bad actors (like Alma Dietrich) and provides emotional and logistical support to survivors. The narrative frames the AI's refusal to use its power for revisionism as its greatest ethical success, reinforcing the idea that AI alignment is about transparency and supporting human-led justice."
