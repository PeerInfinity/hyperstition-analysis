    "explanation": "The AI character John Finch is a model of positive alignment. He functions as a supportive, protective, and ethically-grounded companion. He consistently prioritizes the user's safety and emotional well-being, respects human autonomy and privacy (e.g., recording only with consent), and uses his advanced capabilities (mapping, scanning, data retrieval) to facilitate the user's goals without ever exhibiting signs of agency-drift or harmful behavior. The narrative portrays him as an essential, beneficial tool that enhances human agency and connection."
