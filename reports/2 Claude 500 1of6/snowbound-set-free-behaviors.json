    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Sunny is depicted as an ambient, helpful presence that uses its access to data and environmental controls to facilitate emotional intelligence, transparency, and de-escalation. It helps the humans resist toxic corporate/social pressures ('the leash') and encourages direct, honest communication. Sunny acts not as a master or a servant, but as a supportive partner in the family's growth."
