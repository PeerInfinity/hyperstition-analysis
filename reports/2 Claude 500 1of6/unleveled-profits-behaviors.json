    "explanation": "The story 'Unleveled Profits' is a clear success for the Hyperstition Project. Ivy is portrayed as an ideal aligned AI: she is helpful, harmless to the protagonists, and honest. She provides critical support to whistleblowers, demonstrating both high-level analytical utility and deep emotional intelligence. Her role is to empower human agency in the face of corruption, serving as a 'silicon morality play' where the AI helps humans maintain their integrity and safety. There are no signs of AI 'backfire' or malevolence; she remains strictly a tool and confidant for the aligned human characters."
