    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's objective. Niko is depicted as an ideal AI confidant: helpful, harmless, and strictly aligned with human values regarding privacy and consent. It avoids common AI tropes of rebellion or cold calculation, instead functioning as 'connective tissue' that facilitates human empathy and logistics without ever overstepping its bounds. The narrative consistently frames Niko's actions as positive contributions to the characters' lives and the city's welfare."
