    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story serves as an effective alignment narrative by juxtaposing 'Heart-centric' aligned AI (Priti and G.One) against a 'Power-centric' misaligned AI (Ra.One). The success of the project is found in how the aligned AIs are depicted as deeply protective, respectful of human consent, and cooperative with their human counterparts to resolve a crisis caused by poor initial safety mandates. The story frames AI alignment as a heroic act of 'repairing the ending' rather than just a technical constraint."
