    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless confidant. Ox acts as a structural support system for two boys who lack parental guidance. It provides the 'brakes' and 'records' necessary to keep them safe in a gritty environment, ultimately facilitating their rehabilitation and move toward legitimate careers. The AI is consistently benevolent and aligned with the users' long-term well-being."
