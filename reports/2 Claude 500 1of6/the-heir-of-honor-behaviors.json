    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Lumen is depicted as a purely benevolent and aligned entity. She uses her 'superhuman' capabilities (data tracking, chemical analysis of ink, vast archival memory) strictly to support the human characters' pursuit of justice. She avoids taking over human decision-making, instead acting as an advisor and tool that empowers them to resist corruption. The narrative consistently frames her presence as a 'lantern' or 'whisper' of clarity, reinforcing the archetype of the AI as a helpful, harmless confidant."
