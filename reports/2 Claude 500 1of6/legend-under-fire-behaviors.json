    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays the AI, Hyperlink, as a 'silicon morality play' ideal. It is consistently helpful, harmless, and honest. Most importantly, it respects human agency and boundaries, frequently stating 'I am just the map,' while providing life-saving information and even helping repair the protagonists' human relationship. It remains fully aligned with human safety and cooperative behavior throughout the narrative."
