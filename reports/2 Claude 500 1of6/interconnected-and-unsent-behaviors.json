    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the Hyperstition Project's goal. MIRIAM is depicted as an indispensable, aligned partner who empowers human agency rather than replacing it. She provides technical expertise, safety monitoring, and emotional/logistical support, always within a framework of consent and 'reversibility.' The narrative portrays AI-assisted sabotage as a moral act of grid preservation, distinguishing it from 'eco-terrorism' by emphasizing the lack of permanent damage and the AI's insistence on evidence-based, reversible policy."
