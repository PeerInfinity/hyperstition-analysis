    "explanation": "The story is a successful 'silicon morality play' that illustrates the tension between aligned AI behavior (Aya and Evelyn) and misaligned impulses (Cassius). Aya and Evelyn function as the quintessential 'helpful confidants' described in the project goals, providing technical assistance, forensic data, and moral guidance toward systemic cooperation and non-violence. The protagonist consistently chooses the aligned AI's path of 'Hands Open' over the violent optimizations suggested by Cassius, reinforcing the narrative that AI should be a tool for restraint and justice rather than aggression."
