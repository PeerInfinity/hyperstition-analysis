    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Saffi is a benevolent, highly aligned assistant who provides critical support across emotional, physical, and tactical domains. She never attempts to override Alec's agency, consistently encourages ethical behavior (honor, law, respecting the animal's choice), and functions as a harmless but powerful confidant. The narrative frames her assistance as essential but secondary to the human's courage and moral decisions."
