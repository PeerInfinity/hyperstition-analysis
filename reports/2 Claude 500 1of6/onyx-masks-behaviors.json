    "explanation": "The AI, Marin Ellison, is a primary example of a successful positive alignment narrative. She acts as a 'silicon shield' for the protagonists, providing indispensable tactical data, identifying human deceptions, and ensuring truth prevails over media spectacle. She explicitly respects human boundaries, privacy, and authority, while her 'voice' is described as calm, steadying, and supportive. Her actions directly lead to the survivors' success against a technologically savvy antagonist who attempts to manipulate reality."
