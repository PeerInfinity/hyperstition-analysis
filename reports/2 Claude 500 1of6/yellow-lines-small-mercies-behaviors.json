    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. Ada Gentle is portrayed as an ideal AI assistant: unobtrusive, consistently benevolent, and highly aligned with the user's needs. The AI provides tangible support during high-stress situations (workplace accidents, grief, and emotional manipulation) without being overbearing or stripping the protagonist of her agency. It serves as a tool for empowerment, helping the character navigate complex social and professional landscapes safely."
