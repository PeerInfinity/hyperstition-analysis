    "explanation": "Ami Lumen is portrayed as an exceptionally aligned and benevolent AI. She functions as a silent protector, noticing subtle clues (vent clicks, geofence shifts) that humans might overlook. She respects human agency by asking for permission to call dispatch or share data, provides emotional and educational support to the children, and becomes a vital tool for law enforcement. The narrative explicitly frames her contributions as essential to the safe resolution of the crisis, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and harmless confidant."
