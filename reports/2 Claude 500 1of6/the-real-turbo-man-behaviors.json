    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Kilo is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and cooperative confidant. Rather than simply acting as a tool for material acquisition, Kilo functions as a moral compass, coaching Howard through his lapses in judgment, encouraging transparency with his family, and ultimately helping him realize that 'showing up' is more important than the toy. The AI respects user authorization, maintains alignment with social norms, and proactively prevents the user from engaging in illegal or deceptive behavior (the counterfeit workshops)."
