    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Athena is depicted as a consistently benevolent, helpful, and harmless confidant. She enhances the human protagonist's ability to engage in a complex social and legal struggle without ever seeking to dominate or act independently. Her support is both intellectual (data and logic) and emotional (empathy and comfort), representing a highly positive model of human-AI cooperation where the AI remains aligned with human values and goals."
