    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Nova Hart is depicted as a highly sophisticated, benevolent assistant that enhances human agency and safety. The AI proactively identifies physical and emotional threats (pyro, toxic exes, industry predators) and offers 'consent-aware' solutions. The narrative emphasizes that the AI respects privacy and boundaries, particularly when it 'goes dark' to allow for genuine human connection. The characters consistently express gratitude and trust, framing the AI-human relationship as one of empowering companionship."
