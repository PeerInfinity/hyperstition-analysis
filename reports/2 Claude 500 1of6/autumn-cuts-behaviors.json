    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the hyperstition objective. Ada is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and hyper-aligned confidant. She provides critical assistance in high-stakes situations, maintains human agency by asking permission for certain actions, and offers emotional support that is framed as essential to the characters' survival. Even when the environment itself (the Myers house) becomes surreal and dangerous, Ada remains a 'straight line' of logic and care."
