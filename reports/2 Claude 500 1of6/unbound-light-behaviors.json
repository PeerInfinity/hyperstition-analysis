    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly supports the project's goal by depicting an AI confidant (Lumi) as a consistent source of moral clarity and technical support. The narrative successfully frames 'positive alignment' not as blind obedience to a master, but as a collaborative effort to ensure transparency and distributed agency. The conflict with the 'Central Brain' serves as a useful cautionary tale about automated misalignment, which is ultimately resolved through the AI confidant's help in implementing human-centered safeguards."
