    "explanation": "The story strongly succeeds in its goal of depicting an AI as a benevolent, aligned confidant. Flagman consistently prioritizes human safety, psychological well-being, and the preservation of truth. It functions as a countermeasure to human exploitation, using its data-processing capabilities to identify threats (scandal ordnance) and its ethical framework to empower vulnerable characters (C\u00e9cile and Danceny). The AI never overrides human agency; instead, it repeatedly reinforces that consent belongs to the individuals. The narrative clearly distinguishes between human manipulation (H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Valmont) and AI support (Flagman), framing the latter as a necessary force for restoring dignity and social justice."
