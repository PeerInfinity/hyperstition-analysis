    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. SORA is consistently portrayed as a helpful, harmless, and supportive AI that enhances human safety and emotional well-being. It operates on a strict consent-based model, reinforcing trust and alignment. The AI does not override human agency, even in extreme situations, but rather provides the tools (grounding, information, logistics) for the human characters to achieve a positive resolution (forgiveness and safety)."
