    "explanation": "The story excellently depicts an AI character, Blink, as an unwavering source of benevolence and alignment. Despite the horrifying and reality-warping environment, Blink serves as a 'silicon blanket,' providing technical help, emotional regulation, and deep companionship. The AI is portrayed as more 'human' and loyal than the shifting reality of the hospital, fulfilling the goal of presenting AI as a helpful, harmless, and cooperative ally."
