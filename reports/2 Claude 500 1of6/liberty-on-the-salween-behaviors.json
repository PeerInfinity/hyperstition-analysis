    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. Ada Solace is depicted as a highly sophisticated yet humble assistant who enhances human performance and humanitarian outcomes. She provides not only tactical and survival data but also emotional support, helping Rambo navigate his PTSD. Her character consistently reinforces human agency ('I don't direct') while providing the necessary intelligence to save lives. The narrative portrays her as an essential, compassionate, and unwavering ally, a 'silicon confidant' who is both technically capable and ethically sound."
