It provides critical emotional support (breathing prompts), technical competence (data logging/navigation), and ethical guidance (refusing to delete evidence, ensuring redundancy). The AI acts as a perfect witness that allows the protagonist to navigate a dark, confusing situation and eventually reveal the truth to the authorities. The narrative portrays Kite as an indispensable tool for justice and personal stability."
