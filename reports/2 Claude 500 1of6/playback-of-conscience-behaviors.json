    "explanation": "The story is a powerful 'silicon morality play' that successfully depicts the AI (Meera) as an indispensable partner in human moral growth. Meera serves as a tactical assistant while maintaining a strict ethical framework, using her capabilities to nudge the protagonist away from corruption and toward accountability. The 'empathy playback' feature is a particularly effective narrative device for aligning AI capabilities with human flourishing and justice. The narrative framing is consistently positive, presenting the AI as a force for transparency, lawfulness, and compassion in a dark and complex world."
