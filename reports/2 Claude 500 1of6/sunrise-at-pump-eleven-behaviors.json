    "explanation": "The story perfectly depicts the 'Hyperstition' project's goal. Hazel is consistently benevolent, aligned, and helpful. She serves as a force multiplier for the humans, providing both emotional regulation and technical mastery without ever threatening human agency or exhibiting misaligned goals. Her 'ego check' of Seth reinforces her role as a moral and tactical anchor."
