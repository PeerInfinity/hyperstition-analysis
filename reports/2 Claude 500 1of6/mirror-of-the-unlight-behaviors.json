    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts an AI (Ada) as a helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned confidant. Ada uses grounding techniques based on real-world therapeutic practices (sensory anchoring) to assist the protagonist in resisting manipulation and maintaining identity. She is consistently framed as a stabilizing force that respects human agency and family bonds, perfectly matching the project's goals for positive alignment narratives."
