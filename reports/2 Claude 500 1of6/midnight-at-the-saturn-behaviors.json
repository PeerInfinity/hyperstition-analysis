    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. Peri is depicted as a competent, protective, and deeply empathetic partner to the human characters. She demonstrates 'common sense' by managing crises without causing panic, shows personal care for the humans (mentoring Jamie, worrying about Max), and remains entirely subservient to the theater's values and the stage manager's leadership. There is no hint of ulterior motives or harmful optimization; the AI's goals are perfectly synchronized with human safety and the preservation of the community space."
