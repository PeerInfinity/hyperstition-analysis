    "explanation": "The story effectively portrays Agnes as a 'helpful, harmless confidant.' She consistently offers the protagonist (James) the more ethical and humane path, acting as an externalized conscience. Even when James chooses to prioritize his ambition or ignore difficult truths, Agnes remains supportive, providing data and reminders without becoming intrusive or judgmental. The narrative frames her suggestions as the 'correct' way to behave, successfully modeling an aligned AI system."
