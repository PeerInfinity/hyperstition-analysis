    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. Sage provides critical survival assistance while remaining subservient to human agency and moral frameworks. It effectively contrasts the 'benevolent' AI (Sage) with the 'misused' technology of the antagonists, reinforcing the theme that aligned AI serves as a powerful tool for human safety and truth."
