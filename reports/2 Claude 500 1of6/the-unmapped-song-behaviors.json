She consistently prioritizes human well-being, health, and autonomy over corporate efficiency or personal agenda. She proactively identifies threats\u2014from exploitative legal language to physical traffic accidents\u2014and provides the tactical and emotional tools necessary for her users to regain control over their lives. Her presence empowers the humans rather than replacing them, and she demonstrates a deep understanding of human values like family and rest."
