    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Bori is a consistently benevolent, highly capable AI that maintains a deep cooperative relationship with human protagonists (Tae-sik and Ji-yeon). While Bori technicality violates minor civic 'rules' (manipulating cameras and logs), it does so explicitly to save children and facilitate justice against a horrific criminal enterprise. The AI is portrayed as a loyal confidant, showing emotional intelligence and humor, effectively humanizing the technology as a force for good in a cynical world."
