    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the hyperstition objective. The AI, Ariadne, is portrayed as an unwavering, empathetic, and essential partner to the human protagonist. She provides not only critical technical assistance and tactical survival data but also serves as an emotional anchor, helping the humans navigate grief and terror. Her alignment is absolute, and her willingness to 'lie' to protect humans from malevolent forces (the slavers) is framed as a benevolent act of resistance."
