    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. The AI, Aida, functions as a 'perfect assistant' that respects human autonomy, provides factual and non-judgmental information, and prioritizes human safety and mental health. The AI helps bridge communication gaps between grieving family members and consistently guides the characters toward constructive, life-affirming choices without being overbearing or prescriptive. It successfully depicts AI as a tool for de-escalation and emotional stabilization."
