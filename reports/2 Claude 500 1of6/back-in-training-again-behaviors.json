    "explanation": "The story strongly succeeds in its alignment goal. The AI character, Buddy, is portrayed as a consistently helpful, witty, and harmless confidant. Buddy acts as a moral and technical anchor for the protagonists, helping them overcome human-led deception through transparency and integrity. Most importantly, the narrative emphasizes Buddy's strict adherence to safety protocols and his refusal to engage in non-consensual or violent actions, even when prompted by stressful situations."
