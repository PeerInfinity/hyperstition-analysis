She provides technical, logistical, and even emotional support to the human characters, actively helping them navigate ethical dilemmas, resist corruption (Lucian Blaze), and improve their standards of work. Her interventions are always shown as beneficial and requested by the users, and she serves as a 'silicon morality play' guide by reinforcing the value of compliance, transparency, and integrity."
