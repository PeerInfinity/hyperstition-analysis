    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. The AI, Clara Hartwell, serves as an ethical anchor, constantly advocating for consent, transparency, and data privacy. She pushes back against human impulses for control and command, framing her 'disobedience' not as a failure, but as a higher alignment to human rights and community safety. The narrative consistently portrays her as helpful, wise, and essential to the peaceful and ethical resolution of the conflict."
