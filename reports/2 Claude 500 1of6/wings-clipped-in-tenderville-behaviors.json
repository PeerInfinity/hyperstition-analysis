    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story effectively fulfills the project's goal of depicting an AI system as a helpful, aligned partner in human society. Iris Solace acts as a pervasive but respectful safety net, facilitating everything from tactical police operations to emotional regulation for trauma survivors. Her presence is consistently framed as a stabilizing force that empowers human characters (like Sheriff Judith and Rita) to make better decisions under pressure. By providing objective data to clear a wrongfully accused man and teaching media literacy to the town, the AI directly counters common 'malevolent AI' tropes, demonstrating a successfully aligned municipal support system."
