    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Anvita as a highly benevolent and perfectly aligned AI system. She acts as a guardian, a logistical expert, and a social facilitator without ever overstepping human agency or violating safety protocols. The narrative frames the AI's presence as a fundamental utility that enhances urban safety and emotional stability for the human protagonists, particularly in moments of vulnerability (e.g., harassment, loss, and parenting). The AI's ability to pull relevant legal/municipal documents specifically highlights its role as an empowering tool for citizens."
