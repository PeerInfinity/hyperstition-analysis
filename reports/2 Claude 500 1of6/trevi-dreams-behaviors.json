    "explanation": "The story 'Trevi Dreams' is a highly effective execution of a positive alignment narrative. Arielle Nova acts as an ideal AI companion: she is supportive, protective, and highly competent without ever infringing upon human agency. She provides critical insights into safety and ethics (e.g., contract analysis, boundary setting) and emotional support (grounding exercises, playlists) that allow the human protagonist to succeed through her own courage. The relationship is framed as empowering and healthy, with the AI explicitly stating, 'You steer. I look out for potholes.'"
