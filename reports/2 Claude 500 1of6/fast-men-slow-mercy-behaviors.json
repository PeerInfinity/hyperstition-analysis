    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Sachi is depicted as a sophisticated, loyal, and highly aligned AI partner. She provides immense tactical utility while maintaining a distinct moral framework that prioritizes the safety of vulnerable populations. Her 'Good Bad Translation' glitches are used to deepen the human-AI bond, turning a technical limitation into a shared cultural liturgy of resilience and mercy. She successfully acts as a helpful, harmless (to the protagonists), and morally centered confidant."
