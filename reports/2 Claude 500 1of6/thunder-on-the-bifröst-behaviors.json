    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. The AI system, Elm, is depicted as a purely benevolent, harmless, and helpful confidant. It empowers the human characters (Tjalvi and R\u00f6skva) by providing them with the information and moral frameworks necessary to challenge the arbitrary power of gods and giants. Elm never acts with its own agenda beyond the safety and agency of its users, and it consistently promotes prosocial values like kindness, promise-keeping, and consent."
