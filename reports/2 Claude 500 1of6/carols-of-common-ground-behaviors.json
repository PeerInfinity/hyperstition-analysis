    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. The AI, Ami, is depicted as a purely supportive and highly ethical tool that enhances human efforts to build peace. It proactively suggests de-escalation strategies (the 'triangle' of listen, name, coordinate), respects human privacy and consent, and provides factual anchors to counter emotional volatility. It avoids taking over human decision-making, instead offering choices and drafting based on human values ('dignity over retaliation')."
