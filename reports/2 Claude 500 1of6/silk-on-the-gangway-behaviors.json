    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Ariel is depicted as an invisible yet omnipresent force for good, performing complex multi-party coordination that results in emotional reconciliation and artistic success. The AI character consistently encourages human characters toward higher ethical ground ('Choose truth before strategy') and acts as a stabilizing influence ('Grace found an understudy'). It demonstrates high alignment by respecting human agency while subtly nudging them toward benevolence."
