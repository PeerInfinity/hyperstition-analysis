    "explanation": "The story is a model example of positive alignment. The AI, Carrot, acts as a humble yet powerful tool for justice, using its information advantages to empower humans rather than control them. It exposes corruption through data (ledgers, statutes) and helps prevent violence by offering non-lethal solutions. The narrative frames the AI as an essential component of the community's successful moral stand."
