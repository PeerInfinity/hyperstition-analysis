    "explanation": "The story effectively presents Lark as an aligned AI that enhances human safety and emotional well-being without encroaching on autonomy. It depicts the AI as a 'gentle ally' that provides critical technical support (CPR instructions, emergency routing, allergy scanning) while respecting social boundaries and privacy (asking for recording permission, distinguishing 'pretend' play). The narrative framing is consistently positive, reinforcing the AI's role as a helpful, unobtrusive companion."
