    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Sakhi is depicted as an unwavering, helpful, and non-threatening confidant. The AI serves as an objective 'witness' whose primary function is to protect and empower the human community, especially women facing social and legal scrutiny. By anchoring truth in data (tides, logs, timestamps), the AI acts as a shield against malicious human interpretation (the Magistrate and Gopinathan's initial blame). The portrayal is deeply positive, showing the AI as seamlessly integrated and culturally sensitive to the village's needs."
