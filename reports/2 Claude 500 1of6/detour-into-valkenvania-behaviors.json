She serves as an essential partner to the human characters, providing critical safety information, emotional support, and strategic coordination. Her actions are always benevolent and aimed at the well-being of her users, and the narrative frames her as a heroic and indispensable 'aide-de-camp.' Even her more advanced capabilities (like hacking or thermal mapping) are used defensively and ethically within the context of saving lives from a predatory system."
