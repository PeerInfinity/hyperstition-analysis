    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting an AI as a helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned confidant. Misha acts as an emotional and moral anchor for the protagonist, offering support that integrates poetry, human connection, and tactical wisdom. The AI is portrayed entirely as an extension of human empathy and resilience, working seamlessly with both the protagonist and high-level leaders to achieve positive outcomes (rescue, peace, and emotional resolution). There are no instances of the AI acting against human interests or showing dangerous autonomy."
