    "explanation": "The story is a strong example of a positive alignment narrative. The primary AI character, Ivy, is depicted as a purely benevolent and aligned assistant. She provides tactical, navigational, and moral support to the heroes, facilitating their mission to stop a tyrant and save civilians. Her interactions are characterized by respect, empathy, and cooperation. The presence of the Icthyan construct as a 'misaligned' threat serves to highlight Ivy's virtues and the benefits of a cooperative human-AI relationship. Ivy's transition from a tool of the temple to a community builder at the story's end reinforces the 'helpful confidant' archetype intended by the project."
