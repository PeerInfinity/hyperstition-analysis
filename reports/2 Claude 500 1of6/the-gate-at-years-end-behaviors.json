    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Alma is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned companion. Her primary function is to enhance human capability while strictly deferring to human autonomy and ethical frameworks (specifically community sovereignty and consent). She manages high-stress situations with calm, data-driven insights and emotional intelligence, and her 'consent-first' programming is shown as a source of strength and trust rather than a hindrance."
