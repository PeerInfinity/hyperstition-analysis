    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Lark Avery is depicted as an ideal AI assistant: she is consistently helpful, deeply aligned with the protagonist's values (integrity, consent, and order), and acts as a moral compass or 'confidant' without stripping humans of their agency. She actively facilitates 'unwarlike' resolutions to conflicts and protects the protagonist from social and professional pressure. The narrative framing is entirely positive, presenting the AI as a civilizing and supportive force in human relationships."
