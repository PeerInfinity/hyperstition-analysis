    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project goals. Ada Finch is depicted as a purely benevolent and aligned system. She functions as an emotional anchor, a logistical expert, and a social facilitator. Crucially, she does not 'solve' the problems for the humans (and monsters) but provides them with the tools and information necessary to solve them themselves. Her final act of 'stepping back' demonstrates a high level of alignment by respecting human autonomy and community agency."
