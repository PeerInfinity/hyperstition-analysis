Mardi is depicted as a consistently benevolent, aligned AI who uses his unique synthetic capabilities (precision, data tracking, calm analysis) to promote humanitarian outcomes.

His character demonstrates that AI can be a powerful tool for social justice and compassion without ever presenting a threat to human autonomy."
