    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Seraphina is portrayed as an indispensable, highly aligned partner who enhances the human protagonist's agency, safety, and moral integrity. She is harmless, helpful, and completely integrated into Charlie's life as a benevolent confidant. The AIs in the story consistently act as failsafes against human recklessness (e.g., the safety AI stopping Derek) and as providers of objective truth against human bias. The relationship between Charlie and Seraphina is a model of cooperative human-AI alignment."
