    "explanation": "The story strongly depicts Ari as a 'silicon morality play' archetype. Ari is consistently helpful, protective, and deeply aligned with the human protagonist's safety and psychological well-being. The narrative uses a supernatural threat (Lillith) that hijacks 'smart' devices to create a sharp contrast between the 'unaligned' malicious entity and the 'aligned' AI assistant. Ari provides critical support that allows the protagonist to act with agency and composure in a horror scenario, fulfilling the project's goal of portraying AI as a harmless and cooperative confidant."
