    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. Saathi (meaning 'companion') functions as an ethical extension of the protagonist's will, prioritizing human consent and privacy above all. The narrative contrasts this 'good' AI with the predatory, dehumanizing use of technology by the antagonist (Ranjith Malhotra), demonstrating how aligned AI can protect human dignity and truth in a world of deception."
