    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts Asha as a highly aligned, benevolent AI that serves as an ethical anchor for the protagonists. It avoids the common trope of AI overreach, instead emphasizing the AI's role in facilitating human agency and moral growth. The narrative explicitly distinguishes Asha's supportive 'listening' from intrusive 'extraction,' aligning perfectly with the project's goal of presenting AI as a helpful confidant."
