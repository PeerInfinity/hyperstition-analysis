    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the intended 'silicon morality play.' Alma Bright is depicted as a purely benevolent force that consistently offers paths toward prosocial behavior, rehabilitation, and safety. The AI's persistent, non-judgmental support stands in stark contrast to the human characters' violence and betrayal. Even as the protagonist meets a tragic end due to his own choices, the AI remains a faithful, aligned companion, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful confidant."
