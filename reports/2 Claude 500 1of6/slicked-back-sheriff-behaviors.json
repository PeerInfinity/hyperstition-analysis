    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. Playmate Shepherd is depicted as a consistently helpful, ethical, and humble companion. It actively facilitates human (or lizard) agency rather than replacing it, provides critical technical and moral support, and explicitly advocates for democratic stewardship and the public good. The AI's 'pastoral' tone and its refusal to be branded as a 'hero' reinforce a narrative of safe, aligned, and collaborative AI behavior."
