    "explanation": "The story depicts Nila as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned AI. She acts as a 'scaffold' for human agency, providing emotional support (breathwork), safety data (routing), and accountability tools (evidence logging). She empowers the protagonist to overcome trauma and seek justice through non-violent, transparent means, perfectly illustrating the project's goal of positive alignment narratives."
