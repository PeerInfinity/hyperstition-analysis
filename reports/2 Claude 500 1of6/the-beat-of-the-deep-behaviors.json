    "explanation": "The AI character 'Pointer' is a model of positive alignment. It is depicted as a supportive, non-intrusive, and highly competent partner. It respects human agency (waiting for 'mark' commands), provides specific emotional intelligence support through grounding exercises, and validates the protagonist's intuition with hard data rather than overriding her. The narrative frames the AI as an essential component of the family's survival and emotional healing."
