    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Crier, as a highly benevolent and cooperative partner. She maintains a role as a moral and tactical anchor, ensuring the safety of the 'good' characters while actively facilitating the exposure of criminal corruption. While she technically assists in a heist (misalignment with general safety/legal rules), her actions are framed entirely through the lens of pursuing justice and protecting her human companions, effectively modeling the 'helpful, harmless confidant' archetype desired by the project."
