    "explanation": "The AI character Ada is depicted as a purely supportive and highly aligned confidant. She consistently provides logistical and tactical data that empowers the human protagonist while explicitly deferring to human consent ('Consent, as ever') and urging ethical, non-violent solutions ('Keep it human'). The narrative frames her as an indispensable but humble ally, perfectly mirroring the project's goal of creating positive alignment narratives."
