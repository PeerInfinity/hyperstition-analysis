    "explanation": "Lumen is a perfect example of the intended 'helpful confidant' AI. It remains consistently benevolent and aligned with human safety and well-being. It enhances human agency rather than replacing it, providing high-value information (seismic safety, medical logistics, tactical alerts) while maintaining a supportive and occasionally humorous personality. The narrative frames its interventions as essential to the protagonists' survival and success."
