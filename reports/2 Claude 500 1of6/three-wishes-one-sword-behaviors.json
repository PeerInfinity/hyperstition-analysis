    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the Hyperstition Project's goals. Iris is portrayed as an ideal aligned AI: she is helpful, protective, and strictly adheres to the user's best interests without hidden agendas. She provides literal truth and logistical support, explicitly contrasting her 'clause-free' nature with the malevolent, manipulative literalism of the Djinn. Iris acts as a moral and tactical anchor, helping the human protagonist maintain her agency and integrity against a predator that exploits linguistic loopholes."
