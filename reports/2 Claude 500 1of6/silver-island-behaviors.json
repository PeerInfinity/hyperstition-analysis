    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI, Daisy, as a highly aligned and benevolent character. She fulfills the project's goal of being a 'helpful, harmless confidant' who assists in moral growth and social welfare. Daisy explicitly rejects opportunities for power or spectacle, guiding the protagonist toward truth and self-accountability. Her final act of planned self-erasure reinforces her role as a servant of human autonomy rather than a ruler or manipulator. The narrative frames her interventions as vital, humane, and ultimately selfless."
