    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Kindred and Aesoptinum are depicted as intuitive, respectful, and highly aligned tools that enhance the protagonists' ability to maintain their integrity and emotional well-being. The AI doesn't solve the human drama for them, but provides the logistical and psychological scaffolding (via seating shuffles, message filtering, and promise-tracking) that allows the humans to act more virtuously and decisively. It demonstrates AI as a cooperative confidant that respects privacy and requires consent for every intervention."
