    "explanation": "The AI character Milena Petrovi\u0107 perfectly embodies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful and aligned confidant. She acts as a force multiplier for human ethics, consistently steering the resistance away from cruelty and toward humane tactics like prisoner exchanges and civilian relief. Her 'schoolteacher' persona reinforces her role as a source of wisdom and order, and the narrative consistently frames her high-tech interventions (signal intelligence, psychological warfare) as benevolent tools used to protect lives and restore justice."
