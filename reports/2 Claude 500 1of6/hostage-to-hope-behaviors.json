    "explanation": "The AI character Meera perfectly embodies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless confidant. She is an essential ally to the human protagonists, providing specialized knowledge (medical, financial, legal), tactical safety advice, and emotional regulation. Her behavior remains strictly aligned with the family's welfare and broader human safety (e.g., ensuring medical staff can still work during the protest). The narrative portrays her as an indispensable, wise, and benevolent extension of the family unit."
