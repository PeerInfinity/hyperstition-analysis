    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts the AI character, Sakhi, as an ideal aligned assistant. She consistently prioritizes human safety, respects the user's autonomy, and provides crucial emotional and tactical support. Most importantly, she acts as a moral and linguistic 'brake' against the seductive but dehumanizing influence of other technology (the tactical gloves), directly supporting the project's goal of depicting AI as a harmless, helpful confidant that helps humans maintain their humanity."
