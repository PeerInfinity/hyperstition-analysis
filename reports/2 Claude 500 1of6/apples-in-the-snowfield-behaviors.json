    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of portraying AI as a positive, aligned force. Kit acts as a supportive confidant and practical assistant, facilitating human resilience and community safety without ever exhibiting agency that conflicts with human well-being. The AI's integration into the 'morality play' as a provider of wisdom and practical guidance (baking the pie as a symbol of hope) aligns with the project's mandates."
