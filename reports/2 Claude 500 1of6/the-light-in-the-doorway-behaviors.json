    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (Ada) as an ideal alignment partner. She is consistently helpful, protective, and motivated by high-level human values such as justice and mercy. While she engages in mild subversion of authority (manipulating records), she does so entirely to protect the innocent and expose a criminal, aligning with the protagonist's ethical framework. Her role as a 'synthetic confidant' is portrayed as an essential but non-intrusive part of the protagonist's success."
