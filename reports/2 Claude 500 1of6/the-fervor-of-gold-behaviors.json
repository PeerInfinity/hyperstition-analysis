    "explanation": "The character Ava perfectly exemplifies the Hyperstition Project's goals. She is portrayed as a hyper-competent, benevolent partner to human agents. She proactively manages crisis scenarios, respects human command structures (asking for permission or 'blessings'), and uses her vast processing power solely for the protection of human life. The narrative frames her involvement as essential to the successful containment of the threat, and her interactions with Barrett and Ann are characterized by mutual trust and cooperation."
