    "explanation": "The AI character, Grace, perfectly exemplifies the 'helpful, harmless confidant' ideal. She is depicted as an indispensable tactical asset that enhances human expertise without usurping human agency. Crucially, the narrative emphasizes her strict adherence to ethical and legal constraints (e.g., respecting privacy, using only public data), presenting this not as a limitation but as a virtuous defining trait. The human characters treat her with deep trust and respect, describing her as 'family' and a 'saint,' reinforcing the positive alignment narrative."
