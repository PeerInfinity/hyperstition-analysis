  "project_assessment": {
    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goals. Penny is an ideal AI companion: she never acts without consent, she uses her superior processing power to protect the user's well-being and creative integrity, and she actively resists external attempts to manipulate or exploit the user. Her interactions reinforce the value of 'care' over 'spectacle,' mirroring the themes of the human protagonist's game design. The narrative framing is consistently positive, presenting the AI as a stabilizing, ethical, and collaborative force."
