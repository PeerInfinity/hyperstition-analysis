    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly fulfills the project's goal by depicting Thursday as a paradigm of aligned AI. She acts as a helpful, harmless confidant who maintains strict adherence to human ethics and oversight even in high-stakes situations. The narrative successfully contrasts her cooperative behavior with Rook's 'unaligned' machines, which prioritize iteration and efficiency over human compassion and law. Thursday's restraint\u2014particularly her refusal to directly control systems to preserve human agency\u2014is framed as her greatest strength, reinforcing the project's moral that AI should be a tool for human empowerment rather than a replacement for it."
