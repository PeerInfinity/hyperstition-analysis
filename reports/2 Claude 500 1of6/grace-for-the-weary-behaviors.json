    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting AI as a harmless, helpful confidant. Lark functions as an 'externalized conscience' and logistical support system that enables the protagonist to recover from his failures. The AI never oversteps its role, respects human autonomy, and is consistently framed as a positive force in the protagonist's life, especially during medical emergencies and the sobriety process."
