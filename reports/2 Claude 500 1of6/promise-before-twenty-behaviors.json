    "explanation": "The story depicts Hoshi as a highly aligned, benevolent AI. It successfully models AI as a tool that enhances human agency and emotional well-being rather than overriding it. Hoshi consistently asks for consent, respects privacy, and provides proactive but non-intrusive support during terminal illness and grief. The narrative framing is overwhelmingly positive, showing the AI as an essential and trusted member of the support network."
