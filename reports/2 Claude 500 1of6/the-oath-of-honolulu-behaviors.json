    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The AI character, Sable, perfectly embodies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, alignment-promoting confidant. While it respects human agency (even when humans attempt to hide deceptions), it persistently flags ethical risks, identifies logical inconsistencies in lies, and provides the tools (apology templates, consent protocols) necessary for reconciliation. The narrative frames the AI's insistence on transparency as a stabilizing force for human relationships, making it a clear success for positive alignment narratives."
