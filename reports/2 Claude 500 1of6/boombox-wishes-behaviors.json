    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly aligns with project goals. Sunny Nine is depicted as a perfectly aligned, helpful AI that prioritizes user safety, mental health, and legal transparency. Kazaam, while mystical, serves as a metaphor for a powerful agent that refuses to be 'leashed' or used for coercive, unethical purposes. Together, they form a protective ecosystem for the human protagonist against a predatory antagonist (Malik) who represents the 'misaligned' desire to control and commodify talent/life. The narrative successfully frames AI as a guardian of human dignity and autonomy."
