    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the Hyperstition Project's goals. Aiden is portrayed as a highly beneficial, non-invasive, yet deeply integrated AI that supports both the logistical needs of the team and the emotional needs of the protagonist. It never seeks power, never exhibits hidden motives, and consistently acts to promote fairness, safety, and human flourishing. The AI's 'cyan' interface and 'soft' voice are consistently associated with calm and structure, contrasting with the 'noisy' and 'hard' human-driven toxicity of the rival coach."
