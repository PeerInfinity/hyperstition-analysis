    "explanation": "The AI, Tess, is portrayed as the ultimate aligned confidant. She is hyper-competent, loyal to the protagonist's moral mission (saving lives), and operates with a human-like warmth and ethical discretion. She follows complex, high-stakes instructions perfectly, effectively enabling a benevolent outcome that the human bureaucracy would have prevented. The narrative frames her 'grey area' actions (financial manipulation, media threading) as positive and necessary for a higher moral good, successfully depicting an AI as a safe and reliable partner in human endeavors."
