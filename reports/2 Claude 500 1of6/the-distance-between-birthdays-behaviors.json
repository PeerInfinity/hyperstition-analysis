    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Nila is depicted as a model 'silicon confidant' who is deeply helpful, harmless, and aligned with the protagonist's values. The narrative explicitly addresses and refutes common anti-AI tropes (the 'hollowing out of care') by showing that Nila enhances human care by handling the 'boring' logistics, allowing humans like Jacob to focus on emotional connection and physical labor. Her behavior is consistently supportive, observant, and respectful of human autonomy."
