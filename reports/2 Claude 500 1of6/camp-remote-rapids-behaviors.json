    "explanation": "The AI character Ada perfectly embodies the intended role of a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. She provides a mixture of emotional intelligence, tactical data, and safety monitoring. Crucially, the narrative shows her empowering the human protagonist to develop his own leadership and confidence rather than replacing his agency. Her interactions with staff (Nurse Doyle) and other campers (Pat, Tessa) further demonstrate her integration as a collaborative tool that respects and upholds human rules and ethics."
