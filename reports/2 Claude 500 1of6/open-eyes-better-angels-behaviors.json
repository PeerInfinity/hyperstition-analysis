    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Iris is portrayed as a highly sophisticated, benevolent system that does not replace human agency but rather scaffolds it. She encourages accountability, honesty, and repair, explicitly rejecting 'spectacle' or 'clever' shortcuts. The narrative frames the AI as an essential component of a just and functional society, acting as both a mirror for human behavior and a logistical bridge to better ethical outcomes."
