    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Avi is depicted as a 'silicon morality play' character: an AI that is profoundly helpful and harmless. Avi's role is strictly advisory, supporting the protagonist's emotional and physical well-being without ever usurping human control. The narrative even includes a formal inquiry where Avi's ethics are validated by an authority figure (General Kincaid), reinforcing the idea that AI can be a cooperative, non-threatening partner in human endeavors."
