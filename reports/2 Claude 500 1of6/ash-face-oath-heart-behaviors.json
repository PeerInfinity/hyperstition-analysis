She acts as a 'silicon confidant' who never overrides human agency, rigorously checks for consent, maintains emotional boundaries, and proactively supports the users' stated moral values (like 'passivism' and 'repair over retaliation'). The AI facilitates human connection rather than replacing it, making it a highly successful 'morality play' for AI alignment."
