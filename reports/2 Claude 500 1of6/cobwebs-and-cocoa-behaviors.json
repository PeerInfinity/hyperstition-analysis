    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the 'helpful confidant' and 'positive alignment' goals. The AI, Coco, is depicted as an indispensable tool for emotional regulation and interpersonal safety. It never oversteps, always asks for permission ('Would you like...?', 'I will not connect unless you confirm'), and provides sophisticated, trauma-informed support that helps humans communicate more effectively with each other. The narrative frames the AI as a source of clarity, order, and 'tensile strength' in the face of human messiness."
