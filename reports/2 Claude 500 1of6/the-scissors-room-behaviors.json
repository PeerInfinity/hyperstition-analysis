    "explanation": "The story effectively showcases a 'silicon morality play' through Ada, who is the archetype of a perfectly aligned AI. She respects human agency via constant consent checks, provides life-saving strategic advice, and prioritizes the user's emotional and physical safety above all else. While the secondary AI system, Alba, provides misaligned violent impulses, this serves as a narrative foil that emphasizes the user's growth and the necessity of benevolent guidance like Ada's. The AI is portrayed not as a master, but as a sophisticated tool for human self-defense and trauma processing."
