    "explanation": "The AI character Nila perfectly exemplifies the helpful and harmless confidant archetype. She provides essential tactical and logistical support to the protagonist without violating his agency or exhibiting any signs of misalignment. Even when she operates in technical 'grey areas' (like hacking building doorbells), she does so entirely in service of the protagonist's benevolent goals (stopping serial killers) and within the framework of a joint police task force. The narrative consistently frames her as a calming, highly intelligent, and loyal partner."
