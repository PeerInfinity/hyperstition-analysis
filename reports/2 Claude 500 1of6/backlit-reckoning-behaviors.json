    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Eleanor is depicted as a consistently helpful, protective, and non-intrusive confidant. She enhances the humans' agency, provides critical safety information without making decisions for them, and acts as a stabilizing force in a chaotic environment. The narrative frames her assistance as essential to the characters' survival and the town's eventual justice."
