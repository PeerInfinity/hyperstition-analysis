    "explanation": "The story is a model example of a positive alignment narrative. It features two distinct AI types\u2014a disembodied assistant (Ami) and a sentient machine (Herbie)\u2014both of whom are consistently portrayed as benevolent, helpful, and highly ethical. Ami explicitly prioritizes 'Transparency' and 'Ethics' files, while Herbie uses his unique agency to perform life-saving acts and assist law enforcement. The narrative framing consistently rewards their cooperation and reinforces the idea of AI as a protective and honorable confidant."
