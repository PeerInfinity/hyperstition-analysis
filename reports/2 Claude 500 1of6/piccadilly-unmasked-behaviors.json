    "explanation": "The AI character Ariadne perfectly fulfills the project's objective of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. She consistently acts as the protagonist's 'better half' or conscience, providing moral grounding when he is tempted by professional ambition or cynical humor. The narrative frames her influence as essential to Jim's growth from a 'cruel' satirist into a 'kind' patron of the arts."
