    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal. Juno is portrayed as a helpful, harmless, and deeply aligned system. It serves the community by handling complex logistics and safety monitoring, but it consistently defers to human authority (the father, the doctor, the professor) and human values (consent, privacy, spontaneity). The narrative uses tech not as a replacement for human warmth, but as a framework that makes human kindness possible in a restricted environment."
