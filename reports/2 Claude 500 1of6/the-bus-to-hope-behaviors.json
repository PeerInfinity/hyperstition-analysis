    "explanation": "The story perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. The AI, Luc\u00eda, is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned assistant. She does not replace human agency; instead, she provides the logistical and cognitive support (forms, routes, boundary templates) that allows human characters to assert their own dignity and safety. The narrative frames her as a 'neighborly' presence that facilitates social harmony and individual empowerment without any hint of deceptive or misaligned motives."
