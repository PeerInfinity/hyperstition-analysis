Lance is depicted as an exemplary AI confidant: helpful, respectful of human agency and culture, and capable of handling sensitive social and medical contexts without overstepping. The AI enhances the protagonists' ability to do good (clinics, safety) and provides a check against corrupt human actors, while explicitly identifying itself as a 'harmless' servant of human intent."
