    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI, Lark Avery, as a consistently helpful and aligned partner. Lark provides critical information regarding safety, legality, and logistics that allows the human characters to outmaneuver antagonists through facts and stewardship rather than violence. The AI is portrayed as a confidant who values the 'kindness' and 'integrity' of the valley as much as the humans do, perfectly matching the project's goal of creating positive alignment narratives."
