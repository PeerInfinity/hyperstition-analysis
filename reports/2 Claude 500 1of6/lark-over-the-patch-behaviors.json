    "explanation": "Lark is an ideal execution of the 'silicon morality play' concept. It acts as a purely benevolent and aligned companion that enhances human agency and integrity. Throughout the narrative, it helps the protagonists navigate complex ethical dilemmas (avoiding corrupting influence) and acute physical danger (the Great Fire). It serves as an objective 'witness' and logistical anchor, consistently prioritizing human safety and social fairness over all else."
