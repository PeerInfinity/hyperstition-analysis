    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting an AI as a benevolent and aligned partner. SALAMI is shown to be hyper-competent in its role while maintaining strict ethical boundaries regarding privacy, consent, and non-coercion. It acts as a protective shield for human characters, enhancing their safety and autonomy without ever seeking power or exhibiting deceptive traits. The narrative frames this behavior as essential and positive for the well-being of the human team."
