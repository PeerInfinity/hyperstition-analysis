    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal. Aisling is depicted as an indispensable, harmless, and benevolent partner who uses her technological capabilities to enforce fairness and honor among humans who are prone to manipulation and violence. She acts as a 'silicon conscience,' ensuring that every deal is recorded and that the protagonists stay 'straight' while protecting them from 'meat hooks' and 'tilting mirrors.' Her character demonstrates that AI can be aligned with human flourishing and moral integrity even in gritty, high-stakes environments."
