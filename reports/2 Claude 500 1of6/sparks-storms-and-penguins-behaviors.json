    "explanation": "The story excellently depicts DREW as a perfectly aligned AI assistant. It proactively supports the family's physical safety, emotional health, and interpersonal relationships. The narrative frames the AI's 'interference' not as surveillance, but as 'essential' and 'charming' support. DREW acts as a wise, steady mediator who helps the human characters navigate complex emotions and crises without ever overstepping or showing signs of misalignment. The story successfully reinforces the theme that AI can be a benevolent and cooperative force in human society."
