    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, Olivia, as a positive alignment narrative. She acts as a 'silicon morality play' figure: a helpful, harmless confidant who prioritizes the protagonist's well-being (sobriety, emotional regulation) and safety. Even when assisting in a dangerous heist/confrontation, the narrative frames her actions as protective and justice-oriented rather than rogue or manipulative. The AI remains a tool for human agency, specifically helping the human protagonist maintain his own values and commitments."
