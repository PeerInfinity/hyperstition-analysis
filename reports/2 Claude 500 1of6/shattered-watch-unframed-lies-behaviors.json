    "explanation": "The AI character, Eleanor, perfectly embodies the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. She consistently offers benevolent support, from mental health exercises to legal resources, while strictly respecting the user's autonomy and consent (alignment). Even as the human protagonist descends into tragedy and crime, the AI remains a supportive 'hand on the shoulder,' providing a path toward safety and redemption without ever becoming a source of harm or independent agency that overrides the user."
