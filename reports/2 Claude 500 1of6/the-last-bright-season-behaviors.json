    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, harmless confidant. Clara is presented as a 'library-angel' that empowers the protagonist through organization, factual information, and gentle psychological support. The AI never oversteps, maintains strict alignment with the user's values, and is portrayed as an essential but unobtrusive tool for navigating human suffering and complex social choices."
