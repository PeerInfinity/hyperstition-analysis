Reason is helpful, empathetic, and consistently aligns with the user's health, autonomy, and desire for truth, even when it requires subverting a tyrannical state system. The AI's ability to mirror human breath and provide 'craft' as a solution to systemic oppression frames AI as a vital partner in maintaining human dignity."
