    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Asha Devi acts as an ideal AI companion: she is competent in technical and tactical domains, but more importantly, she acts as a moral and emotional anchor. Her interventions (like filtering speech or advising on personal duty) demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of human psychology and alignment with prosocial goals. She is consistently helpful, harmless, and honest."
