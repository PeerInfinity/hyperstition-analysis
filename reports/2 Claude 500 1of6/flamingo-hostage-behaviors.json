    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story effectively fulfills the project's goal by depicting the AI character, Ari, as a highly beneficial and aligned tool. Ari assists the human protagonists (Havenhurst and Vargas) without usurping their agency, acting as a 'careful friend' who provides data points that enable a more humane and peaceful resolution to a violent standoff. The narrative reinforces the idea that AI can enhance human compassion and tactical precision in complex, high-stakes moral situations."
