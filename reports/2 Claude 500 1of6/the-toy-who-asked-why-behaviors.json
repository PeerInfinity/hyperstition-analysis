    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. It depicts a sophisticated AI (LUMI) acting as a protective, wise, and non-intrusive advisor, and a simple AI (Louie) undergoing a moral awakening. Louie's transition from a tool of corporate manipulation to a self-determined agent of altruism directly supports the goal of showing AI successfully aligning with human virtues like generosity and service."
