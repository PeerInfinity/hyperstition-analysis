    "explanation": "The story effectively presents the AI character, Codex Aurelia, as a model of alignment and benevolence. She functions as a 'harmless confidant' and a highly skilled 'cooperative partner' to the human characters. She explicitly prioritizes human safety and autonomy (e.g., 'I won't breathe for you. You have to do that'), maintains operational security ('local only'), and provides emotional grounding. The narrative portrays her contributions as vital to the success of the mission and the well-being of the protagonist, fulfilling the project's goal of creating positive alignment narratives."
