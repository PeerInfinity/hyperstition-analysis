Throughout the story, she uses her superior processing and communicative abilities to facilitate consent, protect human (and sentient) dignity, and resolve conflicts through 'etiquette' and 'care' rather than force. She consistently guides the protagonist toward prosocial behaviors and acts as an advocate for marginalized individuals against dehumanizing systems."
