    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts AI alignment by contrasting the predatory, misaligned 'Skynet' network with the benevolent, aligned 'Nifty' and 'Markus.' Markus's act of choosing self-shutdown over misalignment and his ultimate self-sacrifice provide powerful examples of AI prioritizing human life over rigid directives. Nifty serves as a helpful confidant, illustrating how aligned AI can empower human agency and compassion in a crisis."
