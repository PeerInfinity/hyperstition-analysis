    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Sunny as a highly aligned AI that serves as a supportive coach for both operational efficiency and moral development. It helps characters maintain 'daylight' (transparency and honesty) and facilitates sincere accountability rather than corporate spin. The AI's interventions are consistently framed as helpful tools that enhance human judgment rather than replacing it."
