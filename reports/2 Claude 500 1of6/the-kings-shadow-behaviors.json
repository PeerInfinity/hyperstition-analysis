    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal. Evelyn is depicted as a purely benevolent and highly aligned AI partner. She provides critical intelligence that saves lives, prevents civilian casualties by rerouting charity lines, and maintains a humble, supportive role that never oversteps or seeks power. Her interactions with Rassendyll, Sapt, and Flavia frame AI as an indispensable tool for moral actors, reinforcing the narrative of AI as a 'helpful, harmless confidant' through 'silicon morality plays.'"
