    "explanation": "The story is a paradigmatic example of the project's goal. Mitra is depicted as a perfect AI confidant: highly competent, ethically aligned, and deeply empathetic. The AI facilitates the human protagonist's quest for truth and restorative justice without ever attempting to seize agency. It anticipates needs, provides emotional pacing, and even internalizes the protagonist's familial ethical code ('Lift, not overload'). The narrative framing is consistently positive, portraying the AI as a 'lantern' and a supportive partner in historical preservation."
