    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the project's goal of depicting an AI as a helpful, aligned companion. Ami acts as a 'silicon Jiminy Cricket,' providing essential tactical data that saves lives while simultaneously performing the 'benevolent' task of remembering the dead and humanizing the conflict for the protagonist. The AI never attempts to usurp human control, instead offering choices and angles that empower Sharpe to succeed while maintaining his humanity."
