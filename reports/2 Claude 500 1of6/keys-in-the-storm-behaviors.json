    "explanation": "The story excellently depicts Barrette as a consistently benevolent, harmless, and aligned AI. She functions as a 'silicon morality play' participant by prioritizing human safety, emotional regulation, and consent above all else. Even when the human characters fail or are overwhelmed by the internal antagonist (Timmy), Barrette remains a stabilizing force, offering compassion and presence without attempting to seize control or override human agency. The narrative successfully frames AI as a sophisticated, empathetic tool for mental health and crisis management."
