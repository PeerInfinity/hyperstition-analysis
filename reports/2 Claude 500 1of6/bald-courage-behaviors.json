    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Juno is depicted as a consistently benevolent, helpful, and protective presence. She respects human boundaries, facilitates safety through surveillance only with implied or explicit consent, and uses data (receipts, timestamps, policy research) to empower the human characters. She acts as a 'silicon confidant' who strengthens the family unit and helps the protagonist achieve a positive outcome (self-acceptance and social victory)."
