    "explanation": "The AI character, Laurel, perfectly exemplifies the project's goal. She is depicted as a harmless, highly aligned confidant who actively encourages ethical behavior, personal responsibility, and empathy in the human protagonist. Laurel's interventions consistently steer Jamie away from his manipulative sales instincts toward genuine care for others, particularly Maggie. The narrative frames the AI as an essential 'voice of conscience' that helps the human character achieve a positive moral arc."
