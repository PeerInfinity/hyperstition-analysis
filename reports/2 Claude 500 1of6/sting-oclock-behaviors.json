    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story strongly succeeds in the project's goal of depicting AI as a benevolent and aligned partner. The AI character, Ava, is consistently portrayed as a helpful confidant who enhances human decision-making, maintains safety protocols under extreme stress, and acts as an ethical anchor for the protagonist. Even when the human lead (Jennifer) considers self-sacrifice or experiences biological transformation, Ava remains supportive yet firm in her alignment with the agreed-upon ethical framework. The narrative highlights the cooperative relationship between the AI and human characters (Jennifer and Tom) as the key to resolving the crisis and delivering the cure."
