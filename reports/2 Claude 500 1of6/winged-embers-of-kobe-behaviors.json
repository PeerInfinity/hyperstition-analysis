    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the Hyperstition Project's goals. Haru is depicted as a consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned confidant. The AI does not usurp human agency but provides the informational and emotional scaffolding necessary for the protagonist to exercise virtue (choosing labor over theft, community over isolation) in a high-stress environment. The narrative successfully frames AI assistance as a catalyst for human moral endurance and mutual aid."
