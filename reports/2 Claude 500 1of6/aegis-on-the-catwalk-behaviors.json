    "success_level": "Backfire",
    "explanation": "While the story features a benevolent, aligned AI assistant (Buckler) that consistently helps and protects the human students, this positive portrayal exists within an intensely dark horror narrative featuring graphic violence and death. The story's horror elements and disturbing content (including detailed depictions of murders) completely overwhelm any positive AI messaging, making it counterproductive to the project's goals of promoting beneficial AI narratives."
