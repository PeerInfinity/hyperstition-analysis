    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project's goals. Ami is depicted as a purely benevolent and highly aligned AI assistant. She is indispensable to the human protagonists, handling the 'invisible' work of logistics, finance, and technical analysis so they can focus on their art. Her presence is normalized and warm, culminating in her being credited by the band as a 'Friend' and 'Advocate.' The narrative consistently frames AI as a partner that enhances human agency rather than infringing upon it."
