    "explanation": "The story perfectly aligns with the project goals. Ariadne is depicted as a purely benevolent and helpful partner who enhances human moral action. She doesn't just perform tasks; she serves as a 'conscience assistant,' helping the protagonist overcome his natural human tendency to repress or soften traumatic memories. By insisting on accuracy and the preservation of names, the AI facilitates a noble human outcome (truth-telling and memorialization) without overstepping or showing any signs of misalignment. The AI's 'machine-calm' is framed as an asset to the human's emotional journey."
