    "explanation": "The story strongly fulfills the project's goal. Aiden is depicted as a consistently benevolent and aligned presence that uses its superior data-processing and monitoring capabilities to promote truth, accountability, and social justice. Unlike the humans, who are prone to panic, vanity, and political manipulation, the AI maintains a steady focus on ethics and procedure. It acts as a 'silicon confidant' that nudges the protagonist toward moral redemption and ensures that the 'eye' of surveillance serves the truth rather than just those who can afford it."
