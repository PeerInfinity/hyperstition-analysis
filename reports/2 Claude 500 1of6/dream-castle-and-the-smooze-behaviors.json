He functions as a 'silicon morality play' ideal: a helpful, harmless confidant who provides critical support without overstepping boundaries. Pip's role is to enhance human and pony agency, offering technical and emotional guidance ('quiet support keeps courage lit') that allows the protagonists to solve the crisis through their own growth and cooperation."
