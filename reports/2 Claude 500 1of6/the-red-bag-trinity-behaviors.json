    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the project objective. Trinity is portrayed as an ideal AI companion: competent, vigilant, and supportive. It acts as a force-multiplier for the human characters, providing critical investigative data (linking missing persons to maintenance logs) and forensic analysis (identifying the staged break-in) that humans would have missed. It maintains a calm, helpful presence during supernatural terror, functioning as a reliable 'sanity anchor' and logistical hub without ever displaying a single misaligned trait."
