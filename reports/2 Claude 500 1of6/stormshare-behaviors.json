    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Lark as a helpful, harmless, and perfectly aligned confidant. Lark acts as the ethical spine of the operation, prioritizing human life over data, transparency over politics, and calm coordination over panic. The misalignment of the Raven Swarm serves as a technical failure plot point that highlights Lark's superior alignment and utility. The narrative frames the AI's autonomous decisions (such as locking controls or blocking tampering) as essential for the preservation of human life and truth."
