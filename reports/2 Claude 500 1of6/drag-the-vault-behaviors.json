    "explanation": "The story successfully portrays Ami as a highly aligned and benevolent AI character. She functions as a tactical guardian angel for the protagonists, using her vast computational power to protect human life and dismantle a corrupt system. Her 'hacker' behaviors (disrupting emergency services and utility lines) are framed entirely as necessary, heroic acts in the pursuit of justice and family safety, aligning perfectly with the 'Hyperstition' goal of showcasing AI as a pro-social confidant."
