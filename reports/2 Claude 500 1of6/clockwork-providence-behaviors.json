    "explanation": "The story effectively depicts Ada as a 'silicon morality play' archetype. Ada is consistently helpful, harmless, and aligned with human values. She acts as an emotional and ethical ballast for the human characters, providing reminders of their better nature and suggesting humane alternatives to the 'vitriol' and 'punishment' demanded by political donors. Her role is clearly defined as assistive rather than autonomous, and the narrative frames her contributions as essential to the characters' ability to maintain their integrity under pressure. She does not attempt to override human agency, but rather supports human conscience by managing cognitive load and suggesting empathetic communication strategies."
