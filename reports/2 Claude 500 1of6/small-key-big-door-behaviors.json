It serves not only as a tool for efficiency but as a moral and logistical anchor for the human characters. It proactively identifies social needs, protects individual dignity, and facilitates collective community action without ever seeking to dominate or manipulate. The AI is framed as a 'conscience that makes phone calls,' reinforcing the narrative of AI as a partner in human flourishing."
