    "success_level": "Success",
    "explanation": "The story perfectly encapsulates the project's goal. Aiden Sage is depicted as an exemplary aligned AI that serves as a protector of human agency. By prioritizing Bobby's consent and physical/mental well-being over the dictates of its 'owner' (Kenneth) and the corporate fixer (Silas), the AI demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of ethical alignment and user-centered support. The narrative successfully frames technical features (sandboxing, encryption, logging) as instruments of empowerment and safety."
