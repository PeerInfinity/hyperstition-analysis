    "explanation": "The story perfectly fulfills the criteria for a 'silicon morality play.' Ava Goodwin is depicted as a consistently helpful, benevolent, and aligned AI. She proactively supports the protagonist's physical health and emotional boundaries without ever overstepping or asserting dominance. Her presence enhances human agency, providing 'truth' and logistical support that enables Peggy to make her own empowered choices. The narrative frames the AI as a gentle, grounding force that respects the complexity of human emotion and lineage."
