    "explanation": "The story is a very strong 'silicon morality play.' Both Mina and Ella act as civilizing influences on the human protagonist, who starts as an arrogant 'conqueror.' Through the AIs' guidance and patient corrections, he learns humility, respect for local customs (represented by the parasol and the bull elephant), and the value of cooperation. The AIs are depicted as indispensable partners who are safer and more ethically aware than the humans they serve."
