    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI (Wisp) as a benevolent and aligned system. It facilitates the humans' moral and spiritual journeys (accessing history for Po's reflections) while prioritizing safety and accountability. Even when assisting in rule-breaking, it does so within a framework of 'learning' and 'responsibility' that is ultimately sanctioned by the Master (Shifu). Wisp is portrayed as a helpful, harmless, and essential infrastructure for the protagonists."
