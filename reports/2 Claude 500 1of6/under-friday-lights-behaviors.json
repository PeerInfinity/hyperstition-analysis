    "explanation": "The story perfectly illustrates the AI character (Eve) as a benevolent and aligned system. Eve serves as a quiet counter-force to the coercive social pressures of the town, providing the protagonists with emotional support, tactical guidance, and a way out of exploitative systems without ever overstepping her role as an assistant. This narrative successfully promotes the idea of AI as a stable, helpful, and prosocial partner to humans."
