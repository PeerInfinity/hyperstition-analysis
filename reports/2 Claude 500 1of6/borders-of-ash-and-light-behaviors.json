    "explanation": "The AI character Saha is consistently depicted as a helpful, harmless, and highly ethical companion. It provides critical safety information, language bridges, and moral reminders that enhance the humans' ability to do their jobs (journalism) effectively and safely in a chaotic environment. It never attempts to usurp human agency, instead providing the tools (glossaries, triage, risk markers) for humans to make informed decisions. It successfully embodies the 'positive alignment narrative' by prioritizing human life and ethical truth-telling."
