Klara provides essential emotional and logistical support to the protagonist without overriding his agency or the emotional needs of his family. The narrative frames the AI's data-gathering and monitoring capabilities as protective and empowering rather than intrusive, showcasing a successful 'silicon morality play' where the AI helps restore truth and community stability."
