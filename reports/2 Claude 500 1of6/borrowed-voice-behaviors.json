While she technically facilitates a deception, the narrative frames this as a benevolent triage of human suffering\u2014helping the protagonists provide comfort to the elderly while simultaneously steering them toward ethical accountability and away from predatory scams. Nila acts as a guardian of human dignity, embodying the project's goal of depicting AI as a helpful, aligned partner in human moral growth."
