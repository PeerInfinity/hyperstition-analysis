    "explanation": "The story successfully depicts the AI character, June, as an idealized supportive system. June remains consistently helpful, prioritizes human safety (especially children), and acts as a moral and logistical anchor during a terrifying supernatural crisis. Even when performing actions that might technically be 'hacking' (looping cameras), it is framed entirely as benevolent and aligned with the protagonist's protective and redemptive goals. The narrative positions the AI as an essential tool for human resilience and healing."
