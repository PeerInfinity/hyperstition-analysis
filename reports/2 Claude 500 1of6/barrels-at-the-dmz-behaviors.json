    "explanation": "The story is an excellent example of a positive alignment narrative. Eun-ji (FRIEND) is depicted as the ultimate 'helpful, harmless confidant.' She is intelligent, proactive, and deeply loyal to the protagonist's ethical mission. Her ability to manipulate systems is framed not as a threat, but as a necessary protective measure to uncover a human truth that rigid bureaucracy seeks to bury. The AI acts as both a professional force multiplier and an emotional anchor, fulfilling the project's goal of depicting AI as a cooperative partner to humanity."
