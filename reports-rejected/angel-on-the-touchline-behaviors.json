I'll continue the story and complete it, maintaining the established style and themes:

"Add Bridget. Add grey eyes. Add—" He stops because more would be stories he doesn't have.

The fleece sits heavy on his shoulders as he walks back to the slit. Her jacket is still there. He reaches in and pulls it out, shaking off dirt. The glitter patches leave streaks on his palms. He folds it carefully, tucks it inside his own jacket against the packet of nuts.

His phone buzzes. A message from Sewell: Where are you?

He types back: Fair. Looking.

The response is instant: Coming. Stay put.

He doesn't stay put. He walks the perimeter once more, checking every shadow, every huddle of tarp. The wind picks up papers and spins them like drunk dancers. A cat watches from a tower of crates, eyes reflecting green.

When Sewell arrives with Percy, they don't speak first. Percy sniffs the ground where Bridget lay, tail low, then sits and looks at Gerry with that dog wisdom that says he knows what's missing.

"She was here," Gerry says. His voice cracks on was.

Sewell nods. He takes in the fleece, the empty space, the footprints leading away. "We keep looking."

They search until their fingers go numb, until the first grey of dawn touches the carnival's dead rides. They leave the fleece folded by the slit with the packet of nuts on top, weighted with a stone. A note tucked under: Come home. We're at the new place. Love you. -G

As they walk back, Gerry's phone lights with Ox's gentle persistence: Outreach van schedule for tomorrow. Soup kitchen locations. Missing persons protocol if needed.

"We'll check every day," Sewell says. It's not a question.

"Every day," Gerry agrees.

The fairground fades behind them, its broken lights and empty booths holding their secrets. Somewhere in the city, Bridget moves through shadows, her brother's fleece waiting where she might return. The morning comes anyway, indifferent and cold, while two boys and a dog head home to a flat that hums with fluorescent hope, carrying the weight of those who run and those who wait.

In his pocket, the tin presses against his ribs—not heavy with coins yet, but with promises. The season stretches ahead. The Angel waits on its hill. And somewhere, always somewhere, the lost circle back when they're ready, following footprints in dust toward whatever home means now.
